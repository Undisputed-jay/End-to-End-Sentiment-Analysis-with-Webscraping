Lee ,Lovely hotel but .....,Couldn't fault the hotel or the resort (although we already knew this as we had been there several times before).My major complaint was being allocated seats by Ryanair nowhere near my partner (25 rows apart on the return journey !) I guess this is the price you pay for a late booking. Won't be doing it again.,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,19 May 2023
Frances,Overall a great experience and glad we…,Overall a great experience and glad we booked through last-minute. hotel was lovely and transfers etc were all grand. Only hotel feedback was that reception seemed a little disorganised which led to extra waiting but overall not a huge deal. The hotel recently opened so I'm sure it's just a teething thing. Hotel staff all very friendly. Breakfast was excellent.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,07 April 2023
赵磊,A decent traveling agency,"I felt a bit surprised when I saw lastminute.com has such a low review score here after booking a flight ticket to Asia, but eventually nothing bad happened to me. everything went well as expected, and the price is lower than average.

Ola Zaid,A follow-up email would be good!,"It would have been helpful for Lastminute.com to send me a confirmatory email and itinerary after I had booked my flight tickets, instead I received nothing.

PJMBARCA,Warning. Never use this company,Never use this company. They will never refund you. We eventually gave up even getting a response. Everyone must see all reviews posted here and also generally online. Lastminute is the worst travel group and effectively got away with robbery¡ with many 1000´s of customers.

Adam Johnson,Refund fraudsters and extorters!,"Please be warned that this company is great if you don't have to deal with their customer service. As soon as you need to make a claim, refund, or help they will simply pass you from pillar to post until you get bored of chasing. Months will pass for 'an escalated refund' just to be told that their terms and conditions mean you're not entitled to a protected no-fuss refund but only a little bit of it. CEO or any c-suite member are uninterested in getting involved to help you and leave you high and dry in the gutter once they have your money.

Joanne Watts,Misled,"I looked up lastminute.com with sky scanner and this deal seemed the best price. On looking at luggage allowance I had 1x small bag and 1x cabin bag of 8kg both ways. Out from Gatwick with BA and back from Venice Marco Polo with Wizz air. Took a screenshot of deal but when it finally came to my confirmation with L minute.com NO cabin bag for Wizzair. Not impressed as I paid basic price with no amendments so had to book a 10kg cabin directly with Wizz and you can only do that if you pay for a priority pass at 30+ quid. Not Wizz’s fault, certainly NOT mine, and I’m furious at being misled.Please could you refer this to somebody who can give me an explanation and some form of compensation as it’s made my flights way more expensive and I could have gone with another company offering what turns out to be a better deal.

Having paid the final instalment on the break I expected that would give me access to the airline website to check in and pick seats.  Not a bit of it.  ""Pay another £5 each and let us deal with it.""  Paid up and (seemingly) no further forward.  Not until 21 hours before flight departure did boarding cards arrive (an anxious wait of several days) and then find my wife & I seated in separate parts of the aircraft: indeed, 14 rows apart on the way back!

Roz ,Beautiful y situated hotel,We really enjoyed our visit and wish we could have stayed longer.  The hotel and its staff were excellent.  It was beautifully situated for visiting all the classic sights.It’s a shame the roof terrace wasn’t a little more user friendly and that the garden wasn’t made accessible.We found the signage at Pisa station a little confusing but one we worked out the front exit it was plain sailing.,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,15 May 2023

Tried in the morning to speak to someone ,again it was a chat function . I want to know if I can’t cancel and get a refund can I just cancel the hotel and keep the flights but keep being told no I will get an email telling me what extra I need to pay. They basically won’t reinstate the flights but I am expected to pay for it and I can’t talk to any human person to try and get to the bottom of it . I am now waiting for the illusive email with dread as to what to do next . I admit to me making the error to start with and I should prob not have cancelled but as I could not get hold of anyone I thought it would be better this way as seen as it was only booked that day .",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,23 May 2023

I received an email confirming my flights had been cancelled, spoke to an advisor who was highly unhelpful and confirmed the flight was definitely cancelled and could take ‘weeks’ to find an alternative flight or ‘months’ to process a refund. After numerous calls back and forth i requested a refund due to the lack of help/support! Later that day i was told by another advisor that if the flight was going ahead i could reopen my booking. Less than an hour later i spoke to the airline, went through verification etc. to find out the flight was scheduled and was NOT cancelled. I then called lastminute.com back to be greeted by another unhelpful advisor who confirmed my booking could not be reopened and proceeded to talk over me when i explained what i had been told.

Kitchen appliances are decent for meals, coat hangers are supplied. Rolled in at 11.45am from amnesia party, easy like a Sunday morning.

Alice,Wouldn’t recommend,"Wouldn’t recommend. Especially their taxi service to and from the airport of your destination. Very unreliable & expensive. First taxi didn’t pick us up so we had to pay for a new taxi & the taxi on way to the airport at the end of our trip was traumatic. Lady couldn’t speak a work do English, and didn’t even know where we were going. We actually thought we were going to crash several times and she dropped us to the wrong terminal which we then had to get a bus on the motorway to our correct terminal. You’re better off booking your flight and hotel separately it will be cheaper. I wouldn’t recommend.",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,15 May 2023

Chloe,Avoid booking holidays with this company at all costs,I booked a hotel and flight with last minute.com for a direct flight from Edinburgh to Budapest for a 3 day short holiday for my mum’s 60th Birthday. Only a month later on 10th May I received an email advising my flight to Budapest was cancelled. Since then I have been offered  numerous alternative flights - these were either a 13 hour stop hour in Germany or the following day at night. Instead of a 3 night trip with the best part of 4 days our trip has now been cut down to 2 days with the added stress of 4 flights instead of 2. I booked these specific dates as I am restricted on the the dates I can take off work so had asked if I can move the holiday as this isn’t my fault and the alternatives were ridiculous. If I wanted to move to a new date I had would be subject to the difference in holiday/handling and hotel cancellation fees which is absurd. The outcomes are then I can either cancel the holiday or go on those flights. I’ve spoken to around 15 members of staff in the 2 weeks since and asked several times for this to be resolved or escalated to management and it’s fallen on deaf ears so I’ve had no choice but to resort to the internet in the hope I can still save my mums birthday present.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,23 May 2023
Beverley,Honest and True review,"Upon arrival at apartments, I gave my surname, ref & booking.com.   Booking not found, very rude hotel staff told me to go away and find correct hotel.   I was trying to show my booking on phone, she wouldn't give me wifi.  Sorted my phone out on 4G went back in and gave her the booking code off my phone,  booking was found under my first name and hotelbeds?  Who are they?   Very upsetting and stressful. You get a leaflet on arrival saying you are living amongst the community and to keep everything with you in case of robberies.   When a bad incident happened mid week, it was outstide recep hours and I was scared.  Reception didnt care, she said I could have rung the police!!.  You also have to clean the apartments yourself on departure,  they dont clean. You dont go on holiday to clean. Think you should seriously consider removing these apartments from your website.

Neil,Left me almost stranded,"On my return journey home, my flight out of Frankfurt was delayed which meant very likely missing a connecting flight in Amsterdam.  The airline KLM refused to help as it was booked through Lastminute, so I had to contact them.  This is where things fell apart.  My phone, for reasons that aren't Lastminute's fault, wouldn't call UK numbers from abroad... but I should have alternate ways to contact Lastminute however this was made impossible.  There was absolutely no way to contact them to try and arrange an alternative flight.  Even suffering through their intolerable auto-chat bot refused to assist me as my email address ends in .group, so even though they accepted my email address when making the booking, their chat bot accused me of entering an invalid email address whilst trying to validate my booking which cut off that channel of communication.  So I couldn't call them, couldn't communicate over that chat, I was totally stuck and helpless.  Facing missing my connecting flight with zero way of contacting the agent was one of the most frustrating and angering situations I've been through in a long time, and one that will ensure I never book through a third party agency again.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,15 May 2023

I responded immediately to the first one - but the emails kept coming. I decided to contact the Riad directly and told them of my arrival time. They had not received any of my responses via Lastminute.com, so just as well I had the initiative to contact the Riad direct. Why reply to Lastmiute if they are not going to forward my responses?Secondly, I organised my transfer via Lastminute (TTC Morocco) and it was a total shambles. I have left a separate review on Tripadvisor for TTC. I contacted Lastminute to cancel the return transfer and refund me as I had to wait 2 hours for the transfer from the airport (TTC are totally disorganised), and their response was to use the return transfer and complain when I get home! Hardly good advice when I was let down so badly on the airport transfer.

I was utterly disgusted by this and therefore wrote an email to the head of the company, which in response he gave me 2 options. I had to pay him personally £500 within a week or I had to pay the company £2500 for a holiday I’m not even going on anymore.

After contacting lastminute.com I was informed the voucher cannot be used on “extras” due to company policy. So lastminute.com cancelled our baggage, put the price up and refunded us in a way that means we are out of pocket having to pay twice+ for baggage. The voucher can only be used on another booking meaning more business/money for them. I sent numerous emails to customercare@ but they would not budge on their policy.

I discovered - seemingly by accident - that there was a change to the flight. Thats where the stress started!a) you are not dealing with a proper travel agent - you cannot just pick up the phone and talk to someone who is empowered to give you options and help you make a decision. They try to funnel you to a chat system that is a massive waste of timeb) even when you track down a number you can actually call, the have to refer things to another deptc) you then get an automated email (that you can't reply to) giving you an option that completely ignores what you had told the agent was going to be acceptabled) I spent hours trying to sort this out and in the end had to fly a day earlier and pay for an extra night at the hotel - a more expensive - the only one left. It remains to be seen whether they will pay for this as I have sent them the booking details 3 times and they still say I have to send it after the trip (contrary to what some of their agents suggested originally)e) I have asked them several times to tell me when they first knew about the flight change (as I discovered it by accident) and they have avoided answering the questionI would recommend you stear clear of LM.com and use a proper travel agent as I found dealing with them very stressful and time consuming",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,05 May 2023

Mrs. Millar,"The Holiday Inn Hotel, Armacao de Pera, The Algarve, Portugal.","The Holiday Inn Hotel, Armacao de Pera, The Algarve, Portugal is in a fantastic location on the beach.   It’s lovely to relax at the poolside, watching what is going on along the beach and watching and listening to the waves crashing onto the shoreline.   A few restaurants and shops are within easy walking distance, which takes only a few minutes.The staff at the hotel are very pleasant and helpful when needed.   The Guest Relations Manageress is very efficient, knowledgeable and helpful when needed.   She is an asset to the hotel.The Reception and Bar areas are comfortable and pleasant; the dining room is adequate.   There is a good selection of food for breakfast and the dining room staff too, are very helpful.The sea view bedroom allotted was rather small, as was the bathroom.    Nothing can be done to alter the size of the bedroom but in the bathroom, removing the old high bath and installing a free standing shower would be a plus.   Such a high bath in a crowded small bathroom makes climbing into the bath for a shower rather difficult, especially for the elderly or those with mobility problems.   Entering the bathroom for a regular sized person, via the very narrow door entrance is slightly difficult, due to the large sized sink.The net curtain at the balcony door and window had a very large tear in it about 3 feet long, which was shredding.   This was reported to Reception, who noted  the defect; it was also pointed out to the cleaning staff but nothing was done about the curtain during our 3 weeks’ stay.    This torn curtain made the room look very unkempt, as did the uncomfortable arm chair in the room which was box like with very high sides.  The chair’s fabric was also faded which made it look shabby.   The room was very clean and was kept in this state by the daily cleaning staff.The aforementioned comments did not detract from our holiday at The Holiday Inn and we would return there again, by which time some improvements may have been made.",Rated 3 out of 5 stars,18 April 2023

Tom,Our flights were cancelled for a trip…,"Our flights were cancelled for a trip to Porto with friends (both outbound and return flights), but Lastminute.com have offered us a whopping total of £29 as a cash refund (alternative options include £130 voucher, explicitly to book through them again). Please bear in mind, this booking cost a total of £1,400. I have since tried contacting their 'customer service' department, through their online chat (you are strongly discouraged to call them, probably because you don't get through, or they hang up on you when you eventually do get through). The agent that I was chatting to on the online chat, 'kindly' explained that I should select one of the refund options offered, but couldn't actually do anything in terms of understanding how ridiculous the refund options were....I was then abruptly cut off from the online chat. I have screen grabbed the chat, in case anyone fancies a quick laugh. Overall, I would classify this customer experience as very painful. The fact that this company is still running is extremely disturbing. I look forward to hopefully hearing from their customer service department, as I have another 2 booking IDs that I will also use at my disposal for other reviews.

The flights were going to be with EasyJet and when we booked the baggage via LastMinute.com, it was very unclear what the options were. We thought we were booking large cabin bags but it turned out it was hold luggage which meant we wasted time at the airports during what was a very short trip. Secondly, when I realised the issue, I tried to contact LastMinute.com (EasyJet couldn't assist) to see whether we could change the baggage booking and I was unable to get a response. My advice? Don't book baggage through LastMinute.com, complete your booking then add the baggage via the airline, that way you know exactly what you're getting.",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,07 May 2023

Chris,Extremely Poor Customer Service Support,"Booked our package holiday with LM.COM and then discovered I'd chosen the wrong dates (change in school holiday dates I wasn't aware of). I knew that the booking including free of charge cancellation of the hotel element so contacted LM.com to request a change of flights so the holiday could be put back just one week (well over 6 months before departure at this point). I was fully expecting there would be some administration charge for changing flights as it was my error. On calling I was informed by a member of the LM customer service team that no changes were possible to the flights due to the type of ticket purchased from Turkish Airlines. I asked what type of ticket they had purchased on my behalf (so I could check with the airline directly) but they said ""we cannot tell you until you have paid the full balance of your holiday!"". I politely challenged this response and was told very abruptly by their representative ""you are not listening to me!"" So I now have to find nearly £5000 6 months before my holiday departure, just to find out what flight tickets I've bought. Something that I find completely ridiculous, considering LM.COM already have this information. I have every expectation that when I pay the balance, obtain my ticket details and contact Turkish Airlines they will allow me to change flights, albeit with an understandable administration charge. Its only after you book with this company and experience their appalling customer support do you start to discover that there are so many other people with similar concerns/issues. We spend around £15000 a year on family holidays but we will never ever use this particular Travel Agent again.

Alana Afflick,"Do not use, they take your deposit when they cancel your trip","Terrible customer service. Holiday package cancelled due to flybe going bust.

This is because the terms and conditions of the travel perk say any cancellation by them or partner companies means that they in effect use the discount you would have gotten on the booking (£160) as your refund. So customers see nothing in a situation that isn't our fault. Even worse is that they said a refund was necessary as no alternative package could be offered, which isnt true, with a week or two replacement flights actually were available and I booked it with them again (as I was expecting our deposit back as their communications said a refund was being processed) no option for credit etc they just take your deposit and you have to live with it, along with a voucher I won't use and a discount for a non existing booking.

I was the one who discovered our inbound flight was cancelled and I notified Lastminute. They have since said they were not informed of this by the airline. Hard to believe. I received an email 3 days later offering an alternative. This is what they should do legally. I accepted. Heard nothing. I chased. And chased. Finally the afternoon before we left, verbally told alternative inbound flights booked. Confirmation would be sent. Never received. Then, whilst on holiday told our whole trip cancelled. Did we have to leave our accomm? Rather stressed that night. Told when I called they were NOT responsible for new flight - airline was, despite the fact they had offered new flights and told me they had been booked. Their legal responsibility was to secure our inbound travel. Had to book return flights home ourselves (thankfully still available). Still received automated emails about alternative flight being booked after we returned! Avoid this company at all costs. They try to sidestep their legal responsibilities and you can only speak to a call centre who know nothing and the same on live chat.I get travel is complicated. I do it for a living. I would have been the most sympathetic customer.

Ratika Singh,Do NOT Trust them at all!,"I have had an unbelievable experience with LastMinute.com. I booked a 2 weeks trip to Turkey and bought flex ticket as I made the booking 3-months before the scheduled date of trip. After selecting flex booking, I found ""Free cancellation"" car hire service listed on their website with no disclaimer of any kind. Since, I anyway have to book car and I saw that it was ""Free cancellation"", I thought why not I buy this as well.My situation changed after 1-2 months when I realised I would be no longer able to go on that trip so I requested cancellation of entire booking about 1.5 months before the travel date. The customer care responded with a refund amount which was ~half of total booking amount which raised my concern and on further enquiring, I was informed I would get no refund for the car hire service. This was shocking as they clearly state that as ""Free cancellation before 2 days of travel date"". On further enquiring, they stated the reason that because I bought flex ticket, I cannot get any refund on car hire service which doesn't make any sense because -1. The service is listed as ""Free Cancellation"" without any disclaimer2. The service was shown as an add-on package after I selected Flex booking for ease of cancellation3. Why would they want to penalise people who are buying flex booking? What would be the use of the car service if the trip has to be cancelled?Since then I have written 4-5 emails to write a complaint on this but the customer care has ignored all my requests.Very disappointed by this experience and my suggestion would be to avoid LastMinute.com as much as you can because one cannot trust what they are putting on their website and they do not respond to their customers.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,30 April 2023

They make it easy to book holidays on there website but if things go wrong god help you. on my booking they reserved a downgraded room at the hotel to what I paid for and sold me an insurance policy which did not cover people of my age. It was impossible to phone them they blocked you at every turn and they do not action emails you send to them. Lost total trust so tried to cancel booking with full refund.

Sue Merrick,We try and visit Amsterdam once a year…,"We try and visit Amsterdam once a year to catch up with Dutch friends and because Amsterdam is such a beautiful city.We stayed in the Holiday Inn at Sloterdijk station this year and it's a very comfortable hotel with a good breakfast, plenty to choose from to eat and drink (too much I've put on half a stone). On the downside naturally, I suppose, it was noisy with travellers pulling their bags along at all hours in the night and refuse workers going about their business. We tried to turn the air com lower but it would not go down low enough to sleep without the window being open slightly. Also our last night, (a Sunday night!) there was very loud music playing until 6.30 am!We would stay there again but ask to be in a room higher up where it might not be as noisy. Oh! another minus against staying there, if you want to leave your luggage after you book out, you have to pay 10 euro per bag, what ever size and not in a secure room but just in the reception area, not very secure at all, and very expensive.

The only way to contact them was through instant chat, which seems only to provide delayed/no solutions.

George D,easy to use website but improvements can be made on the customer service side,"We booked a trip from London to Marrakech (11 Apr - 18 Apr) but we had some issues when we arrived in Marrakech and lastminute.com was costly to contact and ineffective in providing any assistance.The flight was great and we were excited to arrive at our hotel (Barcelo Palmeraie) where most of the resort was great, but although we had booked a ""Family Superior"" room - we were given a ""Superior"" room only and on a building site :(The resort's website states that for the ""Family Superior"" room ""Their balcony or terrace overlooking the lush gardens surrounding the hotel provide an added bonus to this magnificent stay."" but as per the photos provided to lastminute.com - 15 meters from our room they were building more rooms and somehow the lack of garden and sound of angle grinders just did not do it for us.Although I imagine Barcelo Palmeraie should have been honest in declaring they are under renovation, I expected lastminute.com to take that property off from their website and thus ensure that more customers are not sent there but that did not happen!?Also roaming charges are quite high and when lastminute.com keept on calling me to report a lack of progress - that was rather unhelpful and very costly. They really need to consider other methods of communicating like some form of chat, whatsapp etc.Ultimately I appreciate the problem was not created by lastminute.com initially, but they are our agents and they failed in their duty to accurately describe that the resort is under renovation.

Beware the economy flights are not what you think you're getting!","DO NOT USE FOR OVERSEAS HOLIDAYS!it may look cheaper but they fail to mention hidden  very high costs. our booking was a mess from the very beginning.  We booked a holiday to new york. Firstly they book you the cheapest lowest grade flights possible even though when you book it says economy class and you can't change this - its not economy! We flew virgin/delta and in both cases we were unknowingly booked into economy light flights - this means, even though last minute say you can book luggage once you complete your booking you can't,  you have to pay on the day at the airport and its an extra £50 per bag going out and $81 on the way back for hold luggage and you board absolutely last so if you have cabin bags you fight to find locker space. Nowhere on there website does it say you get anything other than standard economy. Be warned, the flights they book you are ZERO frills, everything is extra, you can't even pre book meals or choose your seats. It is impossible to speak to an agent, its all chat bots and emails and they just keep saying that it's in thier T&Cs (which you can not read until after you've booked!) On the one occasion they did call us to discuss our issues the agent hung up on us.Last Minute also advise us on booking as to what you need to pay at the hotel when you check out, this is a USA thing regarding resort fees and local taxes. They told us it would be just over £200 in total - it was nearly $700! Almost 3 times what we were told. All in all we paid over £600 more over the advertised cost of the holiday for luggage and hotel fees.  Last minute once again wash thier hands saying it's an estimate (it does not say that on the website) and that they have no control over local taxes and can not be expected to give accurate amounts! Luckily we were able to afford this but it was a serious shock and many people could get seriously stuck with such a huge unexpected bill. Bad service, poor communication and staff that don't care. For short uk trips you can save but for overseas,  book direct and save yourself the stress. Awful Awful experience.

As already late and not expecting any further joy from receptionist third time of asking, I left it to follow up with lastminute.com. I raised complaint and was contacted by the escalated complaints team who had already colluded with the hotel and told me that I should have phoned their 24 hour help line at the time (I’ve searched every contact I’ve had from them and this isn’t referenced - although there’s a general contact chatbot) and that as far as they were concerned the hotel had fulfilled their obligations by giving me the second non-standard room.

Veselin Matov,AVOID AT ALL COST!,"Where should I start?I booked a long waited holiday to Cancun, Mexico in February this year, which was a full package, hotel and flights included. I booked and paid for transfer from and to the airport as well.At no point of booking lasminute.com informed me that as I have a connecting flight in the USA I would need a visa.A few weeks after the booking has been made and paid in full, I received a phone call from informing me that there is a problem with my booking and the hotel I booked is no longer available. I specifically booked this hotel as I stayed in it 5 years ago and I knew it very well, knew the area and the facilities. During the call I stated and I dont want to be moved to a different hotel as the reason for my booking with lastminute.com was exactly this hotel. Unfortunately, the quy on the phone told me that I have no choice and I have to accept the new hotel which he assured me is way better. He even asked if I am in front of a computer and of I can google that new hotel. He offered me Grand Oasis Palm, which was approx 5 miles away from the original hotel. As I had no choice, I agreed. The email confirmation I received after the call was for a cometely different hotel: Grand Oasis Cancun, All inclusive which as in the opposite direction and 6.5 miles away from my original hotel. As soon as found out I would need a visa for the USA for my connecting flights, which was at the beginning of March, I contacted lastminute.com requesting a cancellation of the flights and refund as I was about to purchase my own direct flights.After having to prove I would need a visa, finally the flights were cancelled and I was refunded only the airfare in the form of a voucher.3 days before my departure date I wanted to confirm with the transfer company, for which I paid lastminute.com, that my flights have changed and to give them my new flight details. It turned out the transfer company had my booking marked as cancelled!I contacted lastminute.com immediatelly to check what is going on. I also saw that my vouvhers for the teansporr company were for the original hotel and not even for the new hotel, Grand Oasis Cancun. A few times lastminute.com sent me the same vluchers woth worng hotel.Finally, when I told them to check themselves with the transfer comapny they confirmed thar there was a mistake and when they cancelled the original flights they also cancelled my teansfers! It was too late to correct their mistakes. I was due to fly the next morning! So, I received a phone call and an email comfirming that I need to purchase new transfer and after I send them the confirmation for payment they would reimburse me. So I did. And guess what they never refund me the cost of the new transfers!!!Alsi at just the day before my flight, they sent me the hotel voucher which appeared to be for Grand Oasis Palm!!! Again change of the hotel. I was so shocked and furious that those bunch of unprofessional dick heads are going to ruin my holiday befire it even started!!!All in all I ended up with a lastminute.com voucher for the cancelled connecting flights which I will most likely never use!I would definately avoid this company as much as I can as they are so unprofessional, lie all the way and are interested only in taking my hard earned money.All that exprerience caused me so unnecessary stress at the beginning of so longed for holiday.My advice to all potential customers: AVOID AT ALL COST!",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,07 February 2023

Claire Keenan,NEVER USE LASTMINUTE.COM,"NEVER USE LASTMINUTE.COM. ALWAYS USE PROPER FLIGHT PROVIDER. Me and my husband purchased a flight at 10pm the night before the actual flight which was with ryanair at 6.50am. By 1am we hadn't had our boarding passes or anything so I got on to the ""chat support"" I explained the situation and the person said we would recieve confirmation shortly. Umpteen times I mentioned about the time of the flight. Fast forward to 6am was still on the chat. I had made sure I took pictures of the chat so nothing can be denied. The agent said they were working to it the appropriate team were working on getting the confirmation from the airline and waiting for a response to their email which I then said won't it be easier to ring them? I received my confirmation email at 6.49 a minute before the flight which by then the boarding online and at the airport had closed. I said this to the agent at 6.40 am also but kept getting told the email has been sent. The agent said this would be escalated and looked into by the appropriate team as to why this was handled in the way it was and the refund request had been put through.We went to the ryanair rep in the airport who looked at the booking email. She looked at the response I had received with my confirmation in it. She also said never to use a company like this again and to book through a proper airline. When she looked at my husbands booking there was a reference number for it but as she saw herself there was no email with this number so he wouldn't have been able to board the plane if mine had came through in time because of this. My husbands confirmation email came at 10.05 that is 3 hours 15 mins after the actual flight.I got in contact with them again today to see where the refund process was at to be told by the agent he has forwarded a refund request for both tickets and that no other request had been escalated. I have also stated I want this put through as high priority. After reading other reviews they needn't think they won't refund the full price that was paid as I have screenshots of everything me saying about the flight time, their response, the email and time it came through, the comment by the agent saying about the refund and escalation of the way it was handled.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,29 April 2023

I asked for a refund they delayed the process of refund till now and no updates till 3 months when i contacted customer service they were saying that they are waiting for airlines to issue refund when i contacted airlines they only made a refund request on 25th april. And i was given the options for refund only today however i am not happy with the amount they are giving me options for as its not even half of what i had paid for booking and there is also extra deductions they are charging if i opt to get refunded on my account. So i contacted customer service and they are misleading me by saying that it depends on airlines but not them and asked me to contact airlines directly when i contact airlines they are saying that there is no cancellation fees from airlines an i should deal with this issue  with agent themselves. I agree with it too as i booked through lastminute and they should be the ones dealing with this. But whenever i contact customer service i am being mislead and no one seems to understand my problem. Every time they are giving me replies which feels like computerised response. There is no empathy from the customer service team too.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,29 April 2023

Mr Chris Bohanna,This us without doubt the worst travel company I have dealt with,This us without doubt the worst travel company I have ever had to deal with. Be warned their terms and conditions are appalling. Booked flights to Scotland with them. However the airline changed the flights which made it impossible for us to make the new return flight. So we told lm.com to cancel the return and we would keep the outgoing. Told we had to cancel both outward and return. We cancelled then lm.com told us because we cancelled we had to pay over £100 in administration fees to them. Even hought the flight company refunded them in full. How they justify this is beyond me. They take weeks to reply and have absolutely no care for the customer whatsoever. . also read their terms and conditions. They read like a solicitor document sending you ll over via links to get the full picture. If I had the energy left after the six weeks arguing with them to no avail I would take up with the ombudsman. Important terms and conditions are supposed to be upfront  and very clear by law. Again be warned all other negative reviews tell very similar stories. They do not deserve any customers....appalling,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,17 March 2023

They don't explain where this price they came up with comes from and constantly say ""the airline issued this"" but only over the phone. Never in writing even after requested multiple times. I looked on the website and none of the tickets are worth £1,500 over the price we had originally paid for the tickets. We should only be paying approximately £100 more to make up for price discrepancies plus the £105 handling fees.

So logged in and went through a lengthy process to register booking with Ryanair. To change the booking by a day would cost over  £300. Fine as that is Ryanairs policy and if I'd booked through them I would have taken out insurance.

nicolai,Latminute.com does not comply with EU Reg. 261/2004,"I had a personal experience in October 2022 when my flight from Copenhagen to Alicante, which was scheduled for January 2023, was canceled. Being aware of my rights under EU Regulation 261/2004, I contacted the booking site, lastminute.com, where I was informed that I could either accept another flight two days later or request a refund. However, the site did not provide an option for a refund despite the fact that a canceled flight is clearly classified as such under the Regulation.I was instructed by lastminute.com to go to the airline's (Vuelings) website to request a refund, which I did. Fortunately, I was given the option to choose between accepting the rescheduled flight or receiving a full refund. I opted for a refund, I was informed by Vueling, that I would get it within 7 days. But after waiting for seven days, I did not receive it. Upon contacting the airline, Vueling, I was informed that as the ticket was booked through an agent (lastminute.com), I had to contact them for the refund.I reached out to lastminute.com, who informed me that it would take 30 days to process the refund. However, 30 days passed and I still did not receive my refund. This led to a cycle of broken deadlines and excuses from lastminute.com, who continued to give themselves more time to process the refund while claiming that Vueling had not paid them.After numerous attempts, I managed to get in touch with Vueling again, who resent the information needed for the refund to lastminute.com. I received an acknowledgment from the site, but they missed several deadlines and when the finally on the 11th of April 2023 offered a refund, they continued to break the law by offering me vouchers or only a partial cash refund.I informed lastminute.com that any contractual terms and conditions that seek to remove or limit my rights under Regulation 261/2004 are automatically void and unenforceable. This means that I was entitled to a full refund of the entire ticket cost, regardless of any contractual provisions to the contrary.The rights granted to passengers under the EU Regulation 261/2004 is clear, and include the right to a full refund of the ticket cost in case of a canceled or significantly delayed flight. It is important for airlines and booking sites to adhere to these regulations and not attempt to limit or remove passengers' rights.It must also be clear that while airlines may offer vouchers or other types of credit, passengers have the right to choose between these options and a full cash refund. Anything less than a full refund of the entire ticket cost would constitute an illegal action under the EU Regulation 261/2004.I'm currently thinking about to take legal actions against lastminute.com, for their very clear violation of EU Regulation 261/2004.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,11 April 2023

Having spoke to her she advised me that she had not changed her passport yet as she was waiting for it to expire (due to the financial cost of changing it). I contacted last minute.com with in the time period required to advise that I had made a mistake. I was advised that no name changes could be made however in the case of it being due to a marriage they would make an exception. The customer service agent then went on to advised me that we could not travel anyway as our middle names were not on the booking. I explained that the booking form did not give the option to provide a middle name. The agent then advised that 'all customers know to put this information in the FIRST name box'. I disputed this and explained that if this was a requirement in the UK the request would be 'FORENAMES' or there would be a sub note requesting the information. He was so rude, I could not quite believe I was talking to someone on a professional level. When I came off the phone I researched TAP website which stated that they did not require a middle name. I then called Last minute.com back to request the name change due to marriage. That was on the 27th Feb 2023. Since then they have requested a copy of my sisters passport and wedding certificate on five occasions (all of which have been provided), we have been sent three quotes for the name change (all of which we have agreed) and we still haven't had the name change! We have called TAP directly who have advised that they would make the change in this case however as we booked through last minute.com it had to be completed through them. We have now been told that it can not be changed as my sisters married name is not on her wedding certificate?!  I have researched many marriage certificates and I cannot find one that has the wife's 'married surname' on it?? I have asked throughout, if they do not feel this can be resolved please could they just be truthful as we have brought tickets for a work conference and we would need to explore other alternatives. I have never been spoken to by anyone, they way 98% of these agents have spoken to me (not even my teenage children). They refuse to advise me what the complaints procedure is and they refuse to advise me how much I will have to pay if I cancel. I have to cancel first, then they will advise. I appreciate there is nothing I can do about the unethical way they work but surely there is something that can be done about this company!

Bhavit Raja,Disgraceful company to deal with,"AN ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL COMPANY TO DEAL WITH. Booked and paid for a short break to Budapest on Sunday afternoon 3.00pm to fly out at 8.00am the next day. Was told I would receive a confirmation email within 15-30 mins. I received nothing and called back at 6.30pm to find out what was happening. I was advised that my booking could not be confirmed but they could not tell me why. This now had to be escalated to a senior staff member (apparently not in the same office and I could not speak to them). Was told that it would be sorted ASAP as it had now been escalated, and also because their phones line close at 8.00pm.I heard nothing again and so called back at 7.30pm, just prior to their lines closing. Was advised that the matter had already been escalated and so there was nothing more they could do: I could not speak to anyone else AND more importantly, I could not cancel at this stage either, as this would be classed as a voluntary cancelation, in which case I would lose my money. Was advised that they would email or message me once the matter was resolved (this at 8.00pm in the evening when I have booked a flight at 8.00am the next day, 70 miles away). Had no message during the night and then at 7.20am (40 mins prior to the flight departure time) I received an email telling me that my book could not be confirmed, REALLY!!If I had read these reviews before, I would never have made the error of booking with this completely DISGRACEFUL COMPANY. My advice to anyone - really think long and hard before booking with them. You may think you're getting a great deal, you're really not. All these reviews cannot be wrong.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,10 April 2023
H Halimi,Worst travel agent to deal with when a…,"Worst travel agent to deal with when a problem happens with your booked flights. Our inbound flight was cancelled by the airline. The airline offered alternative flights which we accepted but the agent took their time to action the changes and every time they came back with the same answer that no alternative flight was available. They forced us to accept a refund which they say it takes up to two months and we had to purchase an other flight at 3 times the original cost because the travel dates now are nearer than when we originally bought the tickets.  3 weeks on we still haven’t received our refund. When we contacted the airline they said that no refund was actioned from their side until now. Disappointing service, very bad communication. You can only talk to a human on the phone when you’re buying a ticket. Anything else is only via chats. Very frustrating.

Agnieszka G.,Very dissatisfied and disappointed,"Having read all the below reviews I’m pretty much scared and I wish I have read those before I made my booking. I do need to confirm however that as per my most recent experience this is sadly all true… I have just booked package holiday with the last minute.com and on receiving the booking confirmation from them I realised that my surname is showing there twice which I do believe is due to some technical glitch on their system. I contacted the team and so far they were extremely unhelpful and just claim that I have to pay them for correction of something that I believe is their tech issue. The communication is poor, they literally REQUESTED me to deal with the airline provider directly to avoid paying the fee (the airline provider confirmed that they do not charge for this change) even knowing that as they as an agent are the owners of the booking so unfortunately I’m unable to make this correction with the airline directly as all needs to go through the agent….. What a waste of time and energy, not to mention waste of money as the main point of using the agent is to make the travel arrangement process smooth especially that they do charge u for booking with them so u would expect professional care with the booking made which this is not for sure! I’m scared to think this but it does feel to me that they may try to deliberately make mistakes on your booking (or use system glitch) and then claim that it is your mistake so u need to pay them even more for getting the correction done. Don’t use them as this all sadly feels like a scam",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,21 April 2023

Karl Gibson,Scammers!,Scammers!! Booked a 3 night trip to Paris for my 1st wedding anniversary flying friday-monday. They cancelled flights and offered Thursday to Tuesday meaning 2 nights without hotel. I had choice to accept or cancel for a voucher. Obviously I couldn't accept and sleep rough for 2 nights. Rebooked to go to Portugal and paid using voucher plus £29 difference by debit card. 2 weeks before we travel and they have again cancelled this trip. My options now are a voucher again or a cash refund for £29 only as I booked the rest using a voucher.  We have no choice but to book again through this company or lose hundreds of pounds.  Customer service is a joke and can't speak to anyone other than web chat.  Apparently if they cancel a booking you have to request a refund or alternative flight yourself or lose the booking.

customer,Terrible.  Disaster in the making.,"Dear Sir,To be honest I would be very reluctant to use your sevice again.  The three main problems are;1) it was difficult, if not impossible to alter flight benefits.  My finance wanted a bag to check in.  We could not do this with the airline. We altered the seats so we could sit together, and yet on the way back she had to sit on a row away from me and was distressed.2) on the way back my finance was given different details on her boarding pass. 3 details were incorrect and these were her surname, the expiry of her passport, and her passport number.  It was only because my dad had died that the officer changed the details.  Otherwise we would have been thwarted to travel on this flight and would have had to rebook another flight.  3) we were given just over an hour to transfer in Chicago airport to another flight, including leaving from arrivals, getting to another terminal, and going through security and finding the flight bay.  Neither of us has been to Chicago and they were doing building works hence absolute choas.  The only way we made it was because the flight was delayed.  I am not joking when I say I would not trust this company again.  I would prefer to book directly with the flight companies.  RegardEdward Dover",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,10 March 2023

So booking through last min has potentially cost me £400 more. My guess is this is some kind of money making exercise for Lastminet.com - you book and they take your money.

Whilst it was annoying, I managed to get another relatively cheap flight through another airline and ended up getting the flight money back in vouchers some weeks later. Hence trip number 2…Trip number 2 was beyond awful. It was the night before my early morning flight to Florence (for 2 people). It did the countdown on the last minute.com app until I was able to check in- at which point, the flights disappeared from my dashboard. It took HOURS of calls/emails to last minute with them saying my booking didn’t exist and quoting the previous one. In the end, I had to personally track the flights departing Heathrow set for the following day to work out my flights were cancelled. Last minute.com did not tell me at any point they were cancelled- I had to tell them! I spent hours waiting to hear anything and it was so so frustrating. At this point flights were insanely expensive and I had lost all of the money on my hotel which was now too late to cancel.Their apology is non existent and I have still not received a penny back. I do not want more vouchers because I vow to never use them again- and I implore everyone to similarly never use them! They are utterly useless with 0 communication and 0 regard for their customers. It’s always worth paying the extra and booking direct- last minute are useless and not worth the worry!",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,16 February 2023

On app it’s showing right date but after making payment date has been changed to 9 April go 10 April. Tried to contact by call found out calling is  only for new bookings. Online chat service is not available at mid night. Got busy day coming out stuck in between. In the morning contacted by chat and they said it’s your fault you have entered wrong date. I have provided screen shoot by email which clearly show date but and also provided full booking details. Luckily received call from agent and he repeated same story that I have made error. I tried to explain and told him to read the date I have sent screen shoot. He did read and said this screen shoot as not any booking reference on it so it’s not proving you are talking about this booking. Wait what are you trying to say I’m playing some gambling to you for one night stay in hotel. He said if you have more proof email and we will cony you later on. I have send more details and preferred to speak with hotel which I made booking for. Good person said to me you will need to pay more amount as much you have paid for this booking go change the date. i said I have double bed  booked you give me small room but I can’t afford more money. He said ok don’t worry I’m not charging any more you can come and we will give you room. In the night I went to hotel at the reception they found booking details but they said we have not received payment for your booking. He charged me £62 and I have paid for it as I need room urgent to get rest for next day work. when I have opened my mobile banking app it shown me 2 payment are gone for this booking. I went to reception again and asked for why have been charged for 2 time for one booking.  I have shown my booking information and also shown the bank statement for the proof of the payment . He said we have nothing to do with last minute we have not received payment and we give you room for new price and you deal with last minute.

zaakirah bhamjee,The most poor customer service I have…,"The most poor customer service I have ever experienced. I was unable to get a visa appointment in time for a trip to Belgium, so I needed to change flights and hotel bookings which I made with lastminute.com. I had emailed lastminute to request this change and after back and forth they said that they are able to change flights but not the hotel. I personally emailed the hotel who then confirmed that the booking can be changed and I should just inform lastminute of this. I emailed this to lastminute who then surprisingly confirmed that they can in fact change the hotel booking but gave me the most ridiculous quote at double what I paid. I then did more research and learnt that the flight change was possible for a minimal amount. I submitted this to lastminute and they then said there was no availability for my dates. After all of that they emailed back saying the change was not possible again due to hotel dates which can't be changed. I then searched the internet to find a number to call them which is not listed on anywhere on their website. The person I spoke to was helpful and said the change is possible and they will get it done for the dates I need. An hour later I received another email saying the dates were not available. I then called lastminute again and spoke to ANISA who was extremely rude, arrogant and did not allow me to complete a sentence during our entire conversation. I hope lastminute is able to give Anisa some training or teach her some manners as she lacks that. I asked rude Anisa what dates were available and she mentioned that I need to give specific dates for them to check and I told them I am happy with any dates. But she was adamant that I have to give her specific dates. After the painful conversation I gave her more dates to check for the change. I got another email back saying the change was not possible again because the hotel dates cannot be changed. I then called lastminute for the third time and spoke to a more decent individual who said that rude Anisa was in fact lying and that the instruction to check any dates is possible and that she will look for any dates to check for the change. After all of this I am still waiting for new bookings...I am deeply saddened that lastminute does not bother to assist me in changing my dates and on two occasions I had to go contact the hotel or do my own research and get prices myself for them to finally do something. This is the worst experience I have had in booking a holiday and it was my first time with lastminute.com.

I did not want this partial refund but the agent on chat encouraged me to accept the proposed refund amount saying if I click through I may get more of my money back from the air line. I was tricked and now they are claiming by clicking the amount I accepted the amount they are offering. They will not cancel the ""cancellation"" so that I can claim credit instead. I will lose 1600k as a result. The main reason for my cancellation was because the flight did not include luggage and this was not made clear. I went to add luggage and was told I could not add additional luggage on a 11 hour flight as a family. They have been absolutely unreasonable and in my opinion knowingly defrauding their customers. The customer care team member Elaine basically said I was mental and kept repeating something she was clearly reading off the board. It's day light robbery. I spoke to the airline who have confirmed they made a full refund back to lastminute.com, however lastminute.com claim that the airline gave them a £400 refund. They are extremely sly and a fraudulent business. They have stolen my money and I am fuming. They will not cancel the cancellation which clearly is a simple step especially as I have not received any money for over 10 days.

Not only have they provided me with incorrect ticketing information several times, but they have also screwed up the bookings at last minute and don't action anything so you have to do it - been very unhelpful. No customer service call line, have to do it via chat - there is about a 5-10 minute wait time for every response to a message, which means that each chat can take hours when it's even slightly complicated - they keep asking for the same information over and over - as they clearly forget what they are doing. Travel was cancelled, then booked on the wrong trains multiple times. Very poor English, very easily confused, un willing to action anything that requires any effort... lack of politeness or apology, passing the buck to Eurostar. I haven't even left yet - not sure if I am going to be able to leave with the way things are (not) organised right now - and they really, really could not care less. Truly, please take this as a warning - pay the slightly higher price with someone who has actual customer service if something goes wrong - as Last Minute really could not care less. I fully expect either no response to this review or some vague, generic line from their social team saying something like ""this doesnt sound good, please contact us on xx"" > and then they will just give me another run around and fob me off to some chatbot who refuses to do anything to help because all they care about is money and not their reputation or their customers.

Jamie Booth,Dreadful service.  Reported to ABTA.,"Utterly dreadful customer service and not even worthy of 1 star.  I ended up reporting them to ABTA following a complaint that took well over 4 months to resolve.1.  They cancelled my accommodation 10 days prior to departure. I have discovered direct from the accommodation provider that this was because LM never even paid the provider for our villa, despite sitting on our money for a year.2.  The alternative accommodation LM offered was both incorrect and insultingly poor.  The original accommodation booked was for a villa with private pool, close to amenities for 9 people.  They offered us a 2 star hotel, single and twin room for 3 people above a night club, in a different town - and following my first contact to complain, adjusted that to 9 people but in an 18-30's hotel again in a different town - Magaluf  (we have 4 under 10's in our party). We had also since found out that the villa remained empty during the time of our booking anyway, so I don't understand why they couldn't re-book.3.  You could not escalate a complaint on the phone with them beyond the first level contact (the person that answers your call).  They couldn't do anything more than make a note and pass it on, leaving you to wait for a call back.  They could not pass the call over to a supervisor or back office team, and I was told ""This is not possible in our systems"".  They took about 2 weeks to respond to any emails.  4.  Contacting them regarding the complaint was both difficult and poorly organised.  Following the cancellation, they left it until less than 24 hours before my flight to contact me back.  After the holiday was cancelled and refund requested, it only got worse.  I was consistently mislead by the first level contact when I asked when the 'back office' team dealing with the complaint would call me back.  I would be promised a call within 48 hours and then receive nothing.5.  Following cancellation - they argued about what refund I would be entitled to until I got ABTA involved, despite very clear government guidance on what refund we are entitled to. 6.  Following LM being contacted by ABTA, it then took a further 2 months+ to actually receive the full refund from them.  I even resorted to threatening them with court proceedings.7.  And they have also recently asked TrustPilot to remove my previous TP review stating that ""they don't think its based on a genuine experience"".  So they're also clearly trying to hide bad reviews.So the complaint was eventually resolved, and I was refunded in full, with compensation for the poor service - but it shouldn't have happened in the first place, they should have been better equipped to deal with it, they shouldn't have argued about it and they should have dealt with it quicker.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,11 August 2022

Chris Torrero,Drag their feet paying refunds,"Booked a trip to Amsterdam involving flights and an overnight hotel stay. Unfortunately, the flights were with FlyBe, obviously not their fault. Two days later, they offered me alternative flights or ""a full refund"". As the flights were from Luton at 6:30 and I live the other side of London, I opted for the refund. After a month, I chased regarding the refund via the webchat to be told, absurdly, that they were writing to the airline. The rest of the webchat consisted of canned phrases pasted into the chat and at best tangential to the issue at hand. One such comment said that refunds are paid within two weeks, despite the fact that a month had already elapsed. They did however give me an email address customercare*lastminute.com where they do at least speak English, even though their care for customers is notable by its absence.Various emails followed with them saying that they are writing to the airline and me pointing out that the airline has gonea bust and that in any case the Package Travel Regulations oblige them to pay the refund irrespective of what the airline does.Searching online, I found to my surprise that lastminute.com is a member of ABTA, so I made a complaint to ABTA about lastminute.com's breach of the ABTA code of practice. I then sent a further message to the email address telling them what I had done and stating that I reserved the right to take them to court.

They’ve basically said we’ve misled/missold you, and you have to deal with it.Who in their right mind would go on a 2 week trip to the Caribbean without luggage. ECONOMY LIGHT wasn’t advertised anywhere at point of purchase and it also states I’ve paid for ECONOMY flights in my confirmation email from last minute.com.

First l purchased full protection for the car insurance which was confirmed on the booking sheet from Lastminute only to find it was extra when I arrived at the check in for the car. Nothing would persuade them to change so waste of money to pay for it. the second issue was I booked bed and breakfast but the hotel charged for  breakfast. A so called mix-up but I think Lastminute claim they are offering something they are not, as with the car insurance. They hope you wont make an issue of it and expect you just to pay up for the so called benefits that they dont pay the supplier for. What is perhaps worse is trying to complain get you nowhere.

If I got through to a person in the chat they would always tell me the same thing and after five attempts someone actually reacted but I suspect that given the names of the people that chat with you that this service has been outsourced to India because those Christian names seem rather familiar to me.This service is abysmal and although I have booked with them before I will not do so again.82 euros and two weeks later they finally changed my name details but it was at a price.

Elvira D.,Paid triple the tickets price,"I purchased flying tickets with this company. They said you need to do an online check in . When i took the flight I actually paid more then my actual return ticket because airline had a certain time space for online booking (24-2hours before the flight).  And same thing happened on my return flight because even Ryanair themselves didn’t make it clear the reason why they charged me (they just said lastminute.com hasn’t updated the terms and conditions so you are not the first passenger to face this). My tickets costed 106£ for me, my husband and our baby , but we ended up paying extra 220£ to Ryanair (2*110£). I tried to speak with airline and they said you need to contact lastminute.com because they should provide that information for you. Later i tried to contact lastminute.com and asked them to review this case and they only said we have sent you 1 confirmation email for your booking and asked to do online check in. I asked them why they never stated the time limit for that online checkin and they said if you didn’t pay extra so that we could do it for you we cant help what is the time limit for airline. Basically they didnt care. So my review here is to help other people who might consider booking with them. Look at the poor reviews they have online. They customer service is the poorest I’ve experienced, they simply don’t care what cause to you. First they misinform you and after they say it is your problem whatever you face because of us.

My wife works in healthcare management and with all the uncertainty at the time, I paid extra for free cancellation in case our plans had to change. I cancelled the trip with 5 months notice as my wife didn’t feel comfortable leaving the country while her staff were under pressure. I then received just over £100 refund and last minute informed me that the remaining balance would not be returned as this was the cancellation fee. After explaining that I had paid for free cancellation, they informed me that the remaining balance would be returned when they receive the refund from the airline. After months of emails and phone calls, they then told me that only the hotel booking was covered by the free refund and the airline would not refund me. I contacted the airline who told me that this was not the case and advised that I contact LM again. Last minute ignored my calls and emails and I’ve now given up on getting a the rest of my refund.

They offered me alternative flights or to cancel so I decided to go with alternative flights options. However over the course of 2 days I never got any information on any alternative flights even though my flight was in 5 days. When I contacted last minute.com to ask them what's is happening they told me one part of my outbound flight was canceled therefore everything would be canceled. They couldn't tell me when my alternative flights would be or on what date I be flying back so this became very frustrating. Eventually I got an email from last minute.com telling me that I had been emailed alternative flights and I was to choose whether I wanted to go with these alternative flights or to cancel. However, I did not receive any email about any alternative flights or any details. When I contacted last minute.com to tell them I never received any alternative flight information they told me that they were working on this. They couldn't tell me my alternative flight information so it became even more frustrating. In the end with lots of talking with bots and also with their customer service on the chat and phone, I decided that this was not going to work because I needed to know when I was going to be flying out and when I would be flying back from Korea. So I contacted last minute.com again, but the phone number didn't work so I had to chat online and requested to have my flights cancelled with a full refund. Now I don't even know if they're going to fully refund me, because they said it wasn't their fault, but I will bring them to court and go to the EU courts if I have to. This company is an absolute joke and their customer service is absolutely terrible I've never experienced anything like this in my life before. I will never book with last minute.com and from now on I'm going to go with the main carriers when booking flights.

I was sent a message but could not understand it as it was formatted in gobbledee-gook.  I also think having to wait until 19 or less hours before your flight to receive a boarding card is a bit of a bind as usually most people travelling towards their airports by then and not everyone has a smart phone.

Vaishali Asher,"I was repeatedly misinformed, led on, lied to and disregarded","Extremely disappointed with the service from lastminute.com and will not be using/ recommending them again. I booked a flight, which I then had to unfortunately cancel - this was actioned within 30 minutes of booking. There was no one to speak to on a call regarding this so it was done online. A couple of weeks later I received a refund which had c£80 missing. To follow this up I had to have numerous conversations with different consultants via their online service. One told me to contact KLM directly because they hadn’t refunded the full amount, which should have been the case as per KLM’s cancellation policy. They disregarded my frustrations and told me to contact KLM directly. I was then diverted back to lastminute.com as my booking had gone through them, KLM stated that they had passed on the refund and this should be followed up with lastminute.com. I then had another consultant claim to take on my feedback following my call with KLM and said they would escalate the situation and I would hear back in 3 working days - I heard nothing. I had to chase this AGAIN with the rudest consultant who lacked basic empathy and communication. I received blunt responses to everything I was enquiring about and they said that lastminute.com have charged an admin fee p/p + another fee. I expressed my frustration, especially as no other team member had said this to me, despite it being their job to know such information (if this is true), and stated I will be taking this further. Before I could ask a follow up question, which I wanted to do, the consultant ended the chat without responding and I was sent an automated message to leave a review.I am outraged at many things to do with the business, but more than anything it’s the lack of knowledge, communication and empathy from the employees. I was repeatedly misinformed, led on, lied to and disregarded by the staff and they are meant to be customer service professionals? My follow up question to the team member was going to be ‘could I have a voucher instead as this was not provided to me as an option and means that both parties miss out on losing money and further time’. If they stayed on the chat instead of closing it the second they had to deal with a frustrated customer, which is their job - they would have saved money and had a happy customer/ great review.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,21 March 2023

As soon as it has been processed, we'll send you an email with all the details. Thank you for contacting us."" So no way of contacting them.

No reason just cancelled.They then told me it would take up to 2 MONTHS to get my money back and said they have requested the airlines approval. This means it will be AFTER my trip I'll likely get a refund. How is this even legal?LASTMINUTE cancelled the flights so I'd expect an immediate refund. This is a terrible booking service and I'd avoid this at all costs. Will NOT recommend. Use other reliable companies. So I have paid for my hotel and cannot refund and now have no flights to get there. When I did look at alternative flights on the website they have increased by over £80 per person. Not only this but I wont get my money back until after so I am even further out of pocket... Absolutely terrible.The only way to deal with Existing bookings according to the phone is a WEB CHAT. Speaking to Mohammad on the chat they basically just said they don't really care your out of pocket by £250 and will have to wait for the refund then when they get the refund they will contact me to organise them refunding it back to to me.

I had to take the full refund but then was told that it was only FULL if you accepted vouchers and in fact they were refunding £100 less if you wanted it sent back to your debit/credit card.How can they get away with this and why would I want vouchers to spend with a company that has just ruined our plans?

They have sent me an email now saying that I have to pay this amount or there will be a court procedure.

I selected parking in my filter search but found I had to pay so I didn't reserve a space and once there, I couldn't arrange a space.There is nobody there to help you out--no front desk so if my daughter hadn't met me there, I would have had a hell of a time getting in. I'm a bit of a techno phone so a real nightmare for me.I managed to pay for a space across the road but had to wake early to avoid a fine. The room itself was nice but right across the street from an office building that could easily see me sitting on the bed so had to keep curtains drawn. Overhead lighting severe so I used the bathroom lights and cooker lights to read.I don't have Netflix or BBC iPlayer so could only use local tv network which was not a good connection. Straw chairs at table a bit uncomfortable.At night, there was a man lurking outside the building, and when I came out, he rushed in. I had to ask if he was staying there and he said his friend was there. Very worrying! They need a front desk person to ensure the right people come in. Very unwelcoming place.

The day of our dream trip to Rome came about... flights with Ryan air.. absolutely fine.. couldn't have gone better for an already anxious flyer. Checked ALL info before flying including our added on transfers which I would like to add do not seem as what they offered at the time. Our shuttle bus (a 7 seater car) arrived late, no call no message just waited too see if they would turn up.. tried to contact aswell as the others on our transfer the office on the form... no answer... 6 calls later and half hour gone we managed to contact an operator who advised that he will be their shortly. Greeted by a really unfriendly chap, the car was falling a part. I was crambed in a boot whilst others had seats that were not safe at all. Was dropped off outside our presumed accommodation what I thought was a beautiful b&b.. walked in and was told by a local who called our accommodation that we were at the wrong place? No we wasn't.. our booking had changed without notification at all from lastminute.com 10am on the day of our trip that the owner tried to contact us... now this all seemed weird as it was... because why are we being contacted on the day with an issue with our booking? Anyhow.. after communication with the owner of said b&b we were directed up to a completely DIFFERENT ""B&B.. This place was horrendous... nothing like the photos of what I had booked.. when I had contacted back saying this wasn't our accommodation I was told... their was apparently plumbing works going on and the owner had apparently contacted lastminute several times too try and get contact to let us know.. how true this is I don't know. The B&B we were chucked into... was not a b&b and more like a hostel.. no breakfast, no privacy, no en suite, paper thin walls, no working hair dryers. Nothing that was once advertised. If people were not talking until 3am then we were being woken up promptly at 6am by people talking loudly, shouting and slamming doors. I wouldn't normally mind but baring in mind this was a far fetch from the place I had booked. This for someone with an anxiety was my worst nightmare and not the relaxing break that I had planned for me and my partner. I've since contacted lastminute via email and have been asked to provide evidence that this has actually happened... luckily I took photos and screenshots of everything.. but I feel like they will not hold accountability for ruining peoples holidays.

Gezster,Wrong Destination !!!,"I've booked hundreds of holidays over the years but I have never had an incident where the website I was using provided flight change options that would offer a different destination?!! So when I booked our package to Fuertaventura and changed the flight times to suit, I didn't think to look at the destination. Our flight was changed to Lanzarote!! I spoke with Last Minute and the flights were not refundable and they said this option works for some!! lol . WHO?? Who books a Hotel for 5 Nights on a different Island to their Flight? So, little useful help or acceptance of responsibilty from Last Minute. An offer to maybe get the Hotel changed, which I didn't want to do because i'd spent all afternoon finding the perfect one to treat my Girlfriend to. I asked if this issue could be escalated to their team to avoid this for other customers in the future, maybe an Alert on thier booking page to say the destination is now changed might help!Luckily we have now booked a Ferry crossing.

Sonic,One star is still too much :(,"I'm giving it a one star but even that is too good. I just had the most appalling service from them when I booked and paid for my flights and money was taken from my account, but the status said 'processing'. After 3 days, I phoned them and asked why it hadn't been confirmed to which they replied that I mustn't worry, and it was a system issue, but all was good with my flights - I'd be getting a confirmation shortly. Next thing, they promptly refunded my money and emailed me that the seats were no longer available. I think that Lastminute are auctioning their seats to the highest bidder and dropping customers when a better fare comes along. I had to rebook with another airline and had to pay hundreds of pounds more because of the three day delay. When I tried to speak to a Customer Service Rep on their chat line to complain about this, he kept feeding me the same line over and over - ""We are just a booking platform; its the airline that rejects the fares' but that's just a line they are taught to say, and a lie to boot because I have booked directly with Qatar many times before and they have NEVER done that to me. The representative then just cut me off the chat without even so much as an ""is there anything else I can do for you?"" and clicked me straight onto a review. Of course, I let rip. I will NEVER use Lastminute again and would caution users to beware - you cannot trust them to make your booking and honour it.

The next morning, we received a rejection saying that there was NO availability on the flight we had chosen.  I re-checked their website and there was.  But they had closed my ""change of date"" transfer request, even though it had not been resolved and now told me via their robot chat line, that it was too late to request a change of date as it was now less than 24 hours to departure.  They already knew that we could not fly as we had CoVid, they had no business closing our ""change of date"" request and furthermore they tricked us into contacting the airline direct.  They told us via their robot to contact the airline direct.  In exasperation, I did.  Without telling me, this meant that they could now wash their hands off me because I had been in touch with KLM.

DIY-er,Why?,"There were two things which I was unhappy with. At short notice we had to make a booking for eight family members to go to Rome. My first complaint concerns the time constraint when booking, especially for that number of people. 30 minutes is insufficient time to properly consider all the decisions you have to make. Why 30 minutes? Why a time constraint at all? My second complaint arises from that time pressure. We chose in haste to pay a premium which would allow us to cancel or change our booking if necessary. A couple of days subsequent to booking one member of our party had an appointment come up which meant they were unable to travel at that time. So, we tried to change the dates but were told that although changing accommodation dates might be possible, we would have to forfeit (pay!!!) the cost of the original flights! This was not made clear on your website! Three months ahead of our trip we were not able to cancel the flight booking despite having paid a premium to do so!!!

Used them several times in the past - won't be making that mistake again. Even to this moment the booking says ""Complete"".. so which is it? Cancelled or not?

They have since refunded me £45.00, I can’t help but feel massively screwed over. I would advise everyone to use a different company when booking or make sure you get insurance to cover yourselves.

Flights got cancelled and have been promised a refund within 2 months. as i was back and forth in contact with the airline 1 month later the airline confirmed that there was never a refund raised to their attention and that my booking was still confirmed and active. This led me to raise a chargeback dispute with my bank and lastminute have now requested me to remove my dispute or else i wont get any money back!! I have gotton in touch with my bank and consumer rights and this is never something you should do as you cannot raise another chargeback when it is cancelled. VERY suspicious. I have also requested on 3 different occasions that a manager contact me and on those 2 occasions i was promised that. A manager has never gotton in contact with me and i was told that there was never a note on my booking that i was promised this. I have all the transcripts saved and when i asked the agent i was in contact with to look at them he disregarded it. This booking was just under €2000 which is too much money for them to be playing around with.

I called up again and was told I couldn't get a refund even though I stressed that I would not have bought my flights through this company if I knew I was being lied to (twice) about hidden costs.

In this case, there was no option left for me, meaning i had to accept maybe 10-20% of the original ticket price once the cancellation was processed, because airline might charge the cancellation fee and remove the tax amount etc. Basically i was left in the dark to take chances and accept whatever comes back to me.

Contacted Last Minute for a refund but they simply refused to give me my money back. Kept saying it was the Airline's policy. So they expect me to pay for their mistake.

I then re-booked the same day.I was advised at the time of cancelling that I would be refunded in full for hotel and as much as possible from the airlines less any cancelation fees (which they were not able to specify at the time of cancellation)The booking total was £2095, they are now trying to refund me only £1390, saying the rest were cancellation fees from the airline, however over a chat correspondence they advised they were able to get a full refund for return flights, and only partial refund for the outbound flights. I demanded a full breakdown of costs which they don't want to provide. I then spoke to an agent over the phone who advised the outbound charges were £300 and return was £180, which contradicts both the chat conversation and also is no where near the £705 that they are not refunding. This proves that they are profiting from the cancellation fees by £100s.

I found Ryanair flights on Skyscanner.net which Lastminute were offering it for £80 cheaper than Ryanair.  Lastminute name rang a bell and I thought since they had been around for a while and their website looked good, I would book with them and avoid the pushy Ryanair website.  The flights from 27th May 2023, and I booked on Sunday evening March 5th 2023. Strangely, no confirmation was received.I checked on the Ryanair site and there definitely were flight available. After 24 hours I started stressing about the flight confirmation. Lastminute have no customer service email or telephone number.After 48 hours I called my credit card company: AMEX said that the £1300.59 was frozen and could not be credited. They suggested that they can only get involved after 4 days.After 60 hours- still no flight confirmation. I checked on Ryanair and there were still a limited number of seats available on the flight I booked. What are Lastminute doing selling you a ticket they don’t have and putting a hold on your funds?If you want to be held ransom, go ahead and book with Lastminute.com. I was desperate because I saw the flight prices going up and I had non-refundable accommodation booking. I finally thought of a solution and messaged their customer service manager via LinkedIn. LinkedIn /company/lastminuteHe did not reply but 10 minutes later I received an email saying that Lastminute could not confirm my flights and the funds would be released. I can’t believe that this company is still trading!There are reviews dating back six years explaining the same practice. This must stop! You can read how they operate right here. bravoflyDOTcom/en/help/your-booking.htmlExcept they don’t provide any time frame when they will book the flight.They are putting a freeze your money and there is no communication. It is not worth the measly savings.By the time I rebooked the same flight with Ryanair, the fares had gone up by £200.Don’t book a flight with lastminute.com or their parent company.

I contacted the Airline who also said I cannot add luggage. lastminute is legally operating through loopholes that allow them to exploit customers, making them pay for a flight knowing all too well they will not be able to add baggage after, but tell them during the booking process that it’s all fine, you can add baggage after you book.

Our flight was delayed by more than the 60 mins  ,so we lost the transfer and money (£40) and had to pay for another taxi ,  then on the return journey the transfer did not turn up !! , if it wasn't for our receptionist at the accommodation who argued the case with the transfer company on our behalf we would have lost that too and another £40 ! . apparently we weren't on the system ? !Incidentally we had all the correct paperwork and confirmation details . For the record an alternative Taxi would have been £23 so nearly half the cost without the hassle ! Last minute.com who we booked it through were not interested and said we should claim off the airline which is all well and good but it was difficult to verify a claim as lastminute.com booked the flights, we did after hours of chat finally get the details and are now pursuing the claim via the airline but will unlikely recover costs .Anyway the moral of the story is ,  just don't book your transfers through lastminute.com , its expensive , risky and unreliable .

Due to this unwanted inconvenience I cancelled the holiday the following day . I was notified of a cancellation fee but not told how much . The next day I woke up to a cancellation confirmation and my bank account had been emptied and they demanded the further payment for cancellation. I attempted to confront the company only to find that you can only get in contact with them if you have a booking ID and as my holiday had been cancelled I couldn’t speak to anyone .

I explained I couldn't access my old email and had a booking under it online so didn't want to delete the account, but no matter what I said, the responses were mainly unrelated to anything I said, and when they were it wasn't helpful. I'm not sure if it was also the language barrier, but the only plus side is I know now never to use them again, and that they have no ability to send complaints to anyone else, no one to pass you on to when you're getting nowhere with someone. I've heard so many bad things about them before but unfortuntately i'm now one of those people who will be sharing that information too.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,06 January 2023

D KING,AVOID - Will Not Give The Refunds They Promise,"Whizz Air changed my flights on a couple of occasions, meaning we would miss the entire first day of our short holiday.  Last Minute said I could therefore cancel and request a refund for the ""whole package"".  When I tried to proceed with obtaining the refund, the customer services agent on the chat service checked & said this wouldn't include the cost of the flights as it was a budget airline!  I tried again with a different customer services operator who also 'checked' and they confirmed I could indeed have a full refund.I therefore requested to proceed with a full refund.  When the confirmation emails came through, it gave me various choices.  Basically, if I wanted the full amount refunded, I needed to accept a voucher with LM and if I wanted a refund to my original payment method, I had to accept a deduction of £50.  I was annoyed as this wasn't mentioned but I just wanted to be shot of the company, so I accepted the loss.They then confirmed by email that £514.92 would be credited to my payment card (£50 short of the amount I originally paid).  Fine.  They actually credited £464.92 a further £50 short, leaving me £100 down.  Again I had to brave the customer services chat and the agent insisted that they refunded me £514.92.  I argued that clearly they hadn't as the credit from them to my account was £464.92!  Were they suggesting that my credit card company stole £50 from me then?!  They would not change their stance, simply reiterating that they credited the correct amount and for me to contact my bank.So I had no choice but to contact my credit card company, who (obviously) confirmed I was only credited £464.92 by LM.  I have now opened a Dispute against them concerning this outstanding amount.Do not trust them with your money.I've now booked with my usual Expedia (& avoided Whizz Air for good measure).",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,06 March 2023

Peter and Kamann,Easy check in and smooth flights. Bit irritated at hidden online check in charge.,"I was very impressed with the check in and baggage drop service both at Bristol and Paphos airport. Very quick and simple with lots of helpful Jet2 staff there to assist. Both flights left bang on time, everything went smoothly and on-board staff were helpful and friendly. I’d happily fly Jet2 again, except …My only niggle was the hidden extra charge for online check in. I think most other people on the flight were with a Jet2 package and had been able to check in long before the day of the flight. We were with a different operator and only using the Jet2 flight, so only got to check in 24 hours pre-flight. When I went online there were only two seats left, everything else was booked. These were a little distance apart but I didn’t see that as a huge problem. So I selected those two seats and was shocked to find I’d have to pay £13.50 per seat for the privilege of taking the only seats left!  Same on the way home. I felt this was a bit sneaky. It’s all very well advertising yourself as selling low-cost flights but to then sneak an extra £54 on the overall cost, just for the privilege of online check in (which is a completely automated, internet procedure, involving absolutely no human input from the company staff) left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars,19 February 2023

Angry and frustrated does not even come close to how i feel about this company.I booked 2 x one way tickets, (with cabin baggage and hold luggage) to Perth for November 2023 (we are emigrating, so baggage is absolutely CRUCIAL). When the booking confirmation came through there was no baggage added to our booking. I have been in communication with Lastminute.com and the short version of this story is that they were unable to add our bags onto our booking due to a 'technical error' and can no longer add the bags on because the airline have already confirmed the tickets. They have told me I have to either add the bags on online, or do it at the airport... the cost of this is now £660 PER BAG, instead of the £127 we've already paid for two bags. They have refunded what we have already paid for the baggage, but this does not help at all. They are refusing to refund the cost of the tickets, that i may be able to repurchase flights with bags. The cost to add the bags to our booking at this stage is costing more than the two one way tickets we've already purchased. And just to add insult to injury, the current price of these tickets (with baggage included!!!) is £300 less than the initial price we paid. When speaking to Lastminute.com it would appear they just read from a script and give the same scripted answers over and over.

Sharon Patey,Well where do I start..... Horrendous from start to finish..although it's still ongoing,"Well where do I start... Having booked flights lastminute to visit my mum in south africa because of illness I arrived into Johannesburg to find that my flight had been cancelled by the airline, however lastminute had only sent the email 3 hours before I was due to take that flight at this point I was already in SA. As advised in the email I approached the airline to book replacement tickets, they were unable to organise this which left me no choice to book and pay for a new flight. When told by Lastminute to request a refund for the cancelled flight this is what I did, however they decided that I had supposedly asked for all of my further flights to be cancelled, finding this all out 3 days before I was due to fly home. Trying to get in contact with anyone from customer services that I could actually speak to rather than chat to over the stupid webchat setup was impossible there is NO phone number that doesn't automatically hung when you ring it and no email address. With no other options I had to once again fork out £800+ just to be able to get home. I am now trying to chase a refund, having spoken over the webchat and telling them that if they did not get in contact with me I would be lodging a formal complaint with the CAA. Funnily enough they decided to listen and give me a call back.. who knew human beings worked at this company!!!! However even after this I am still going to be left waiting 28days for a refund.

We decided to choose the alternative flight with the shortest layover but lastminute.com confirmed us onto the longest layover. Once we found out the error we got back in touch with them but they were unhelpful. After days of continuously being cut off by the online chat they still refused to change the flight to the other alternative as they said it was unavailable. This was actually untrue as we checked with the airline and it was available.We then decided we would like to request a refund for the flight, however, we got told this was not possible due to the airlines policy. I am not sure how this can be so when the airline cancelled the flight in the first place?!This has been an absolutely terrible experience and there is no way of communicating to anyone apart from their online chat.I would highly recommend paying that extra couple of quid and going direct to the airline for future flights.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,28 February 2023

Chris,Non-existent customer service,"Holiday to Egypt booked in July 2022.10 days before we were due to fly I received an email from Lastminute stating that our hotel was overbooked and we didn't have accommodation. They suggested an alternative hotel and asked for confirmation on how we wanted to proceed. I read recent reviews on this hotel and they were largely negative so I provided my own list of hotels that we would be happy stay at.I then heard nothing from Lastminute at all for 9 days. I telephoned them several times but the agents I spoke to were unable to help me as they said they were not able to as they didn't have the authority. When I asked to speak to a manager they said they were unable to do this either. My case had been 'escalated' but they couldn't give me any time frame as to when someone who could help me would be in contact. I also received no useful reply from emails sent to their customer service team.As you can imagine this was stressful and worrying. On the afternoon the day before we were due to fly I received another email saying that in fact the original hotel was available after all, sorry for the inconvenience. So I had 9 days of worry, stress, phone calls, emails, and chats with their customer service team for nothing.The holiday itself had its own issues but that is not for here. A few months later I then received an email to say I had been overcharged tax and provided a voucher that can only be redeemed with Lastminute. I took the plunge and contacted their customer service team one final time to ask for the refund to be in cash to the card I used to purchase as I would never ever be using Lastminute again for anything and that I had deleted my account but my request, unsurprisingly, was refused.This company is a joke and knows nothing customer service. Agents are not able to actually help and can only take calls and 'escalate'. Great if you don't have any issues but an Orwellian nightmare if you do.

I will NEVER use them again! Informed me the day before we were leaving for our trip that they couldn't offer me my booked and paid for hotel anymore. Offered me terrible alternatives that didn't suit. Spent 3 hours arguing with rude members of staff the day we were leaving trying to sort a new hotel. We had originally booked a 5* hotel with a lovely spa and their ""spa"" alternative was a 2* bed and breakfast that had a bubble bath in the room. Eventually they agreed to refund booking and 50% of new booking for a different hotel on their website which was now £300 more expensive due to booking 3 hours before arrival. 3 weeks later and 5 more phonecalls I was told that I would only recieve 30% refund on second booking and there was nothing I could do about it because that was the final decision! Wouldn't let me speak to a manager or the third party advisor after firstly telling me if I had an issue I would have to take it up with the hotel provider, then wouldn't pass on the details and said actually I can't contact them. The trip ended up costing me £120 more than original price of £289 and I recieved no compensation at all. I wouldn't have booked the hotel again with them had they not agreed to the 50% refund. They say the person should have said up to 50% not actually 50%. What good is that to me 3 weeks after we've paid and stayed.

It has now been 4 months and I am still awaiting this refund. After calling numerous times it’s impossible to actually speak to someone over the phone as they hang up the line or say someone will call you back and they never do. I’ve sent off numerous emails and every time I get a terrible response back saying they are still waiting for the refund from KLM.

I have asked over email for someone to call me or the email address of a senior manager which every time they avoid giving me.I will never be using last minute EVER again due to this issue.

The agent said that she was calling, trying to contact the hotel and get a waiver for a refund.

The agent told me that their offline team would try to keep contacting them and get back with me within 72 hours. I heard nothing for double that time....Then I received an email stating that they tried and couldn't reach the hotel, so I don't get a refund.This site took a tight financial situation at the time and made it way worse.

I was told there was no alternative flight available, so they cancelled all of my flights ( as it was all under 1 booking). So the only option I had was a refund minus €35 for a ""handling fee"" for processing the refund. What a joke. I was told it could take up to 8 weeks for a refund. So in December I had to find money and book another flight to Perth when the flights where more expensive given it was Christmas time. I rang twice to follow up on when I was getting my refund. They where useless on the phone. All I was told was it was being processed. Over 12 weeks passed and I couldn't get through to anyone on the phone. THANK GOD FOR PAYPAL, I escalated a claim through them and my bank. I finally got my refund but it caused alot of unnecessary stress. I will never book through them again. Awful company to deal with.

We chose not to pay for our seats and were sat a few rows  away from each other but we knew this would happen. Flight was great, cabin crew were friendly. On arrival at the airport we went to the “Abas” desk, the people handling our transfer, this was quick and easy to sort and we were soon on our coach. The only down side about this was the coach driver was quite miserable and literally just stopped the coach in the side lane of our hotel without calling out the hotel name, luckily we knew it was our stop but another couple hadn’t realised and almost missed it!   The Hotel Gran Bali was beautiful, we were in a tower sea view room. The beds were big and comfy. The bathroom clean and tidy and the views were incredible!  British TV channels if you wanted to watch something whilst getting ready or relaxing and music channels too. The food was lovely and plentiful and was restocked regularly. Salads, meat, chips, mash, roasted potatoes and so many wonderful cakes to choose from. We were all inclusive so we also had drinks included. Breakfast was also really nice, all the things you’d expect in an English breakfast but with salads, bread rolls, cereals and fruit also available. We weren’t restricted on drinks during the day but we could only have two each on each visit to the bar. You could pay toUpgrade to Premium Brand alcohol but they had all the drinks we liked on the standard all inclusive. Unfortunately the gym and sauna equipment were being refurbished so not available for our use. This didn’t really detract from our enjoyment as we went walking around the local area instead. We would visit this hotel again and recommend to others although in the off season there isn’t a great deal for young children and it was mainly older Spanish guests using the hotel but they were all extremely friendly.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,12 February 2023

Sounds simple right? Of course not. Contact last minute.com explaining the situation and providing an email from the hotel confirming agreement to refund. Receive an email soon after from the customer care team that they had contacted another 3rd party who i presume the hotel booking was made through had denied the request of a refund because we didn't make contact with them at the time. Firstly I don't know who this other third party is, so tricky to make contact. Secondly the matter was dealt with by myself and the hotel who have agreed the one night refund. Lastminute.com and the other 3rd party are not losing out on any money here as the refund is agreed. Following on from the refund being refused lastminute.com have gone quiet.

Shamsul Alam Mohammad A Hoque,Confirmation /Booking ID 2204481273,"Confirmation /Booking ID: 2204481273; dated 24/11/2022 On 24 November 2022, we booked an international flight from Heathrow via joint airlines (QATAR & BRITISH AIRWAYS), where tickets were sold by ""My Bravofly"" using the online search engine. 1. Before our scheduled departure date of 18/Jan/2023, there were three emails received from BravoFly (dated 08/Dec/2022, 21/Dec/2022, 23/Dec/2022), stating that our confirmed international flight timetables were re-adjusted. All those three email messages stated, ""Important information: schedule change to your flight"". We understand there may be changes required for any technical or operational reasons but without asking the passenger, all new timetables were accepted by the Ticket Selling Agency, Bravofly. We have tried to contact Bravofly, but no reply. Registered as a member on their website but no action. After purchasing the tickets, Bravofly does not take any responsibility. Communication or any sympathy on our journey plan was ZERO. 2. Then, we arrived at our International Destination, fine. No further issue with that. The only thing we were not sure was about our CHECKED IN Luggage weight. The confirmed ticket and checked-in information state that 25kg for all outbound and inbound flights (both directions of travel). We were travelling by joint operation by British Airways and Qatar Airways in Economy Class tickets.3. All went ok, until our return journey, dated 09/Feb/2023, while tried to check in, we found that the check-in luggage is showing a maximum of 23 kg. We contacted the Airport Official (Qatar Airways) they said our ticket was sold as jointly operated by BA and Qatar airways. As per British Airways, the maximum economy class weight we could get is 23 kg. We knew this, living in the UK, we were aware of this 23 kg weight restriction imposed by British Airways. Based on the above information, my question to BravoFly Sales/Customer or Marketing team is, before selling tickets to a customer these things require passing the audit checking process. We all use online search engines to receive tickets, even with all validated/verified ticket searching online websites, for a single ticket, we found there are more than twenty agencies, who could provide us with that same ticket/flight with a very marginal variation of selling prices. Sometimes, after receiving money from the card - i) is very difficult to contact the ticket-selling broker/agency; ii) received an email but the email address does not allow has to contact them. iii) Following receiving the ticket, even if we require to change the date or any amendment (with payment), there is no scope for that.   We have completed our journeys with adjustments that's why I am giving that SCORE 2, otherwise, this type of joint operation airline and ticket-selling agency should received a Net ZERO score.",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,09 February 2023

customer,scammed. 2281795455- booking ID,"I do think it’s all the same with booking sites the only issue I had was their refund policy , I paid for the premium package which means if you ask for a refund they do not charge any of their fees on top , only charges you’ll get is with the airlines . And the airline has a policy if you cancel within 24hrs you will be given a full refund . Long story short I booked a flight and cancelled and was told I will be refunded but it’s charged me £50 because of the airline because their policy is you have to do it within 24hrs . I then reminded them that I cancelled in 17hours . They then said it was because it was at midnight and then how it’s not them and it’s the airlines . How can you pay for a package that’s main policy is to make sure you don’t get charged and the airlines policy is also that you get a full refund within 24hrs . How am I then getting charged when you’re promising me with the policy that this wouldn’t occur. I own my business so I know that’s just out of order when you provide a policy for customers which they pay for , you got to full fill and uphold your policies . I even asked to speak to someone that I may be able to speak to who can help and I was just ignored and constantly told excuses that changed and did no validate the £50 charge. I do believe if maybe I talked with someone in higher management they would listen and understand better as most people do when looking at the bigger picture , but customer service chats is so unprofessional to the point I’ve just lost money that goes against their own policies .

john hart,2week holiday cancelled by last minute.com 15 minutes before check in.,"My wife and I booked a 2 week holiday to Orlando on January 5th. We booked the flights and hotel so it was a package deal. We were booked on the 11o clock flight from Manchester to Orland this morning. We had trouble booking in 24 hours before the flight. At this point we contacted last minute.com via their on line chat as it is not possible to speak to a human so they say. We were told not to worry our concerns have been passed to the relevant people and we would get a reply asap. Nothing came through at all for the rest of the day, even though we had contacted the chat help line with more desperation each time only 18 hours till the flight. We had no choice but to get up at 4am the next day and drive the 170 miles to the airport and try to check in. We contact the chat help again at 6:55 from the airport check in queue only to be told someone would now ring us direct. (So you can speak to a human if they let you).. we were called 15 minutes before the check in desk opened to be told our flight and hotel has been cancelled. No explanation why or by whome. The caller at this point was desperate to get off the phone and leave us in the airport in the check in queue with all our luggage. He did not offer us an alternative flight and hotel or any compensation. He did say we would receive a refund. We had paid £120 to park our car at the airport for 2 weeks and we had a hire car booked in Orlando now too late to cancel it we will lose a lot of that money. To sum it up we are now hundreds of pounds out of pocket no holiday and no chance of getting a replacement holiday by last minute.com who did not care 1 little bit of the situation they have put us in. We are totally devastated to have been treated like this. We had no choice but to go back home to process what has just happened to us.

The trip was dated October 16-23rd and it clearly stated that it could be cancelled up to 24 hours before. The hotel and very probably the flight would not have been paid in advance however they still have not refunded my payment - 20 weeks later!!!! Last Minute.com may have a website that can take your booking and payment instantly, however, they also have the worst customer service in the world. It is almost all virtual and they are impossible to contact via telephone or email. When you follow their refund procedure you only ever receive automatic standard computer messages.

Patrick Leahy,DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY ... Ever ...,"Let me start by saying that I very very rarely take the time to review a company, unless it is a small local business and I have received a good experience. However, Lastminute.com has not only been the worst experience I have ever had with a company, but has left me severely out of pocket with hidden cancelation fee's. I paid for a holiday for me and my other half which cost upwards of £450. I made a mistake in the booking so I went to change it (5 minutes after booking it, and 4 months ahead of the booking date.)When I pressed cancel, there was no mention of a fee, instead they charged me well over £500... Without any notice what so ever.......Quite literally more than the cost of the holiday, without a single note saying that it would cost me money. I even opted to get the travel plus package. I have now spent the last Month ... going back and fourth speaking to various employees, all of whom have given me different information. Some telling me to wait, and that I will get a refund, others telling me I will not get anything. Additionally some telling me I can speak on the phone, other's telling me they cannot allow this. Even on 3 of the occasions being told they will call me within 24hrs, and then not receiving a call. I have reached out to customer care team, several assistants on the chat tab and even the companies social media, and yet no one has offered me any sort of refund, or vouchers. In this journey of trying to get a refund, I have been informed that there are regulatory bodies for this type of thing and have now escalated my disbelief about being charged a cancelation fee, greater than the booking, without any prior warning to ABTA. So... although I do not usually take the time to review experience, I wanted to warn anyone who is thinking about using this company.. DO NOT DO IT. I hope this has been of help to anyone reading it.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,21 February 2023

I contacted the airline the following morning who told me I would need to contact each airline separately (multiple airlines involved) or pay at the airport!  As the flight was completely unsuitable, and not what was advertised, the airline advised me to cancel the booking as the EU standard is no charge if you cancel within 24 hours.  I cancelled with LastMinute and claimed a full refund.  LastMinute paid less than €500 back!!  LastMinute claimed they were only an intermediary and I needed to talk to the airlines.  The airlines refused to discuss the case stating I needed to go via LastMinute?!  How do LastMinute get away with this?  After much correspondence and many dismissive responses, LastMinute admitted they negotiate separate terms and conditions for each ticket, which they do not publish!

So I paid 3x the price for a new outbound flight, we then tried to change the name on the return flight and because I didn’t board the outbound flight they couldn’t do the name change, I’ve then had to get another flight for the return which cost me 5x what the original flight cost. Basically I’ve had to fork out an extra £550 for a flight to and from Amsterdam all because they didn’t process my name change, would’ve forked out £35 a flight if I was made aware. I hope I can get some sort of compensation",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,17 February 2023

I spoke to someone online, they said they could request a refund, from the airline and that I would get all the money back. I then had to quickly find and book new flights for 6 people 1 week before the holiday! They received a full refund from the airline, but when I asked about my refund they only offered a voucher for the full amount or for a cash refund they would charge me £36 per person admin fee! So they would keep £216 for failing to inform me my flight had been cancelled and not helping to find new flights. Absolute joke I will never use again and please avoid. It says online if your flight is cancelled then you will receive a full refund, this is a lie.

The service is poor.2) They will rinse you if you need to cancel your holiday. They charged me £340.00 for cancelling the holiday on the same day.3) When you try to ring them after they have rinsed you, the line does not connect to an agent (what surprise)!This company is not a reputable company, they are rip off merchants and if they read this review and feel my comments are defamatory or libellous, I dare them to take it further with me because they will have to prove these statements are untrue, they will not be able to.  There are far more superior holiday companies out that that will allow you to amend bookings online and are in fact cheaper. Save yourself, and your bank balance a huge headache and avoid them. I can't stress enough how utterly bad this company is.

Mr McGoldrick,Unfortunately I booked with Lastminute.com,"Unfortunately, I dealt with LM before reading the reviews on here.I booked a holiday with them, which all looked fine. Till I got home and realised I was flying with WizzAir and Vueling.Both carriers I had never heard of before. I discovered why for good reason.Now, I don't normally look at reviews for airlines. It's an airline, it only has one job. How could it get it wrong.And to my surprise, both WizzAir and Vueling had so many recent bad reviews it made me think this was a big mistake. I asked if I could change airlines and was told no.I then looked on Trustpilot and read recent very bad reviews about Lastminute.com.I booked our holiday at 11:30 in the morning, paid a deposit of £117.63p and cancelled it by 22:00 that same night.I can't say I was happy at the thought of losing the deposit but if that's what was going to happen. It would be a valuable enough lesson for future reference.Then the bombshell hit the day after my cancellation. They wanted a further £471.51p in cancellation fees.The bloody holiday was only £1100. How the hell can it cost half the entire price of the holday to cancel it?They are basically saying, it costs £500 odd in fees alone to book a holiday.The resorts must be modern day Robin Hoods, taking money from the rich to give to the poor. Giving us all holidays for absolutly nothing as it costs so much for admin fees.I will be contacting both my bank and credit card company to complain but I suspect, like everyone else on here. My money will be well and truely gone.I am normally big on reading reviews before doing anything, but who would have though a well known travel company would be guilty of fleecing, cheating and alienating their customers to the point where most of their reviews are ""Terrible""I would like to know how they get away with it and how they can sleep at night. There are tens of thousand of people wirting negative reviews about Lastminute.com, and yet still they get away with it.Needless to say, I will never deal with Lastminute.com again. I will also never book a flight with WizzAir or Vueling as it looks like, if you don't pay for them up front. They don't assign seats when you checkin. They can then put you on standby and move your flight randomly.

Paul Nelson,Avoid lastminute at all costs,"My wife and I booked air tickets in July 2022 for a trip to New Zealand through lastminute.com  The airline changed our itinerary in September 2022 and we were asked by lastminute to accept the changes. We duly accepted but a few weeks later we noticed that the third leg of our outbound journey (Auckland > Dunedin) had not been changed. The changes to our itinerary meant that we would arrive into Auckland a day later than the original booking. (22/12) However, third leg was still showing as departing on the 21/12/22. We contacted lastminute via email, telephone and through the online chat over a period of several months. I even emailed the company's MD but never received a reply. lastminute claimed that they could not request the changes and even at one stage cancelled our whole trip which we had paid several thousands of euros. I also spoke with the airline, Emirates, on several occasions but they required lastminute to request the changes for the third leg of our outbound journey. lastminute never requested the changes and as this trip to NZ was so important to us (we were going to see my son and our two grandchildren for the first time in three years), we made our own arrangements for the Auckland > Dunedin leg at additional cost. Since returning from our trip, I have been in contact with lastminute and Emirates to obtain a refund for the flight we could not take. lastminute are again refusing to help obtain the refund. I have travelled quite extensively over the last 30 years and used many travel agents and airlines. lastminute are far and away the worst travel industry organisation I have ever dealt with and in fact I would go as far as to see they are the worst company I have dealt with.

I went with refund as the emails looked fishy and I didn’t want to lose more money by rebooking.Later I also saw that I got an email from AirIndia offering to upgrade to business class for the same flight with some extra money.

I knew I had to book the seats separately so once I did the booking I rang BA to arrange the seat. They said that unfortunately because I booked through a third party, they would have to arrange it. Ok no probs I shall speak to last minute and ask them to do it. Oh dear Lord…. First I found that there is no number to ring them, that should’ve been my first red flag.Then I managed to speak to someone on the chat who said that the airline doesn’t allow for infants to have a separate seat. I then pointed out that that is incorrect and that I had spoken to BA who assured me that it is possible. “We will pass this to the relevant team” Got an email from said team “yeah we can’t do it” Got on the web chat again(after speaking with BA again who now also provided me with 2 phone numbers for their support teams and said that LM can ring them for assistance) Gave this info to LM and promptly got an email back from the support team “yeah we can’t do it”I sincerely regret not buying the flexible option, so I could cancel and get a refund!Don’t be like me, book with someone else!!!",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,03 February 2023
Ann Luch,Never again.,"Freaking horrible, borderline fraudulent. If you're unlucky enough to have your flight cancelled, you will have to fight like hell for a refund with the airline, because lastminute will sure as **** not help you. A subpar, low-quality company that does not care about their customers, can't and doesn't want to support you at all, and their ""insurances"" are a waste of money, because eventually they are just a scam, they don't really mean anything. Their customer service workers are a bunch of lame ducks quacking the same ""I suggest you check back with the airline"" nonsense over and over again. Good luck doing that, when most airlines only have automated, i.e. useless phone assistants, and the only booking data you have is from lastminute, not from the airline, so it is worthless on the airline's website.

Jay Gohil,Ruined a good holiday,I use booking.com for alot of my hotel/apartment bookings and have had no issues UNTIL this.  I went online in July 2022 and looked at properties to stay in Goa. Found one which was reasonably priced and affordable. Then as booking.com had a tab to book flights I duly clicked on the flights and was taken to lastminute.com. I thought no more about this checked the flights and booked and paid fully for the holiday. I received the confirmation and receipt. Our flight was on 25 January 2023. We boarded . No issues. Got to the hotel at about 0600hrs on 26 January to be told that I hadn't paid for the two apartments. They allowed us to stay.  The manager was understanding and asked me to chase the payment.  I contacted lastminute for payment   they stated they were on the case. Anyway after nearly 14 days into our holiday the manager was still unhappy that no payment had been received and threatened to cancel our booking and that I would be required to make the full hotel payment. Though booking.com and lastminute.com are partners  getting anything done was like pulling teeth out without anesthesia. My holiday was being ruined by the fact that the manage kept chasing me for funds and I had to keep chasing lastminute.com and booking.com for payment and reassurances. Finally on 8 January 2023 the hotel received a confirmation of bank transfer payment. The staff I dealt with were good and fast with their communication at lastminute.com.Frankly this whole experience has put me off both booking.com and lastminute.com.

You ask if you can get a refund or rearrange dates or something, AND THEY ACCUSE YOU OF STEALING (ironic). THEY CHARGE YOU AN ARM AND A LEG TO CHANGE DATES.

James Browne,Do not use this agent. You may well lose your money.,"As with many others on this site, we had a flight cancelled in May 2022. No help of any sort was offered. Ultimately in October 2022 they refunded £190 from a flight cost of £1,100. They blamed the airline but offered via their automated chat service to help us complain. We took this up but the automated system cancelled all chats as soon as a ""live"" assistant came on. I can only assume that this is a deliberate policy of retaining customers' money. This is not how a reputable organisation should behave. It is not possible to speak to a human being in person. Do not use them.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,10 May 2022

Jordan Gunning,If it was possible to leave 0 stars I…,"If it was possible to leave 0 stars I would. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I booked a city break to Bordeaux as a Christmas present at the start of December. I paid a premium given that I was booking just before Christmas and because I selected the best possible flight times. After countless flight changes meaning my booking was cut so short that I no longer had any interest In going through with this booking anymore I was given the option of a full refund. When I tried to take them up on this option offered to me it has been withdrawn on the basis that the airline has confirmed the flights times and that I am too late. Despite since having had email correspondence from lastminute.com telling me that the flights are not yet confirmed and that this is completely false. But now I am being told as the flights aren’t confirmed this would be taken as a voluntary cancellation from me. They cannot get a story straight constantly changing between confirmed and not confirmed and are making this the worst customer service experience I have ever received. Every time I try and get a solution I am told on the phone to the customer care team that this has been escalated and “please kindly be patient” I have been waiting long enough and have been patients long enough. The booking was made in mid December and we are now approaching mid February with no solution. All I want is to accept the refund that was offered to me in writing via email as the booking has been nothing short of appalling the amount of times it has been changed in me and certainly isn’t even close to the booking I paid a premium for at the time. Avoid at all costs and do not spend any money with them, I can tell you from experience you’re better flushing it down the toilet. If someone from the company would like to contact me regarding this booking I would appreciate it.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,06 February 2023

Yes, it stressed me out that the day before I was due to fly out  I was left trying to contact EasyJet customer service (now that would be 2!!!), but it wasn’t there fault I didn’t have all of my details available in time to complete the necessary online forms. So instead my rating reflects the service LM were able to provide, which quite frankly can’t be faulted. All correspondence is laid out in a format that is easy to understand, with the key information easily accessible. I’ve already used them to source some more flights and, going forward, I will definitely continue to do so as their website is so easy to navigate and they provide an excellent service.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,24 January 2023
Entesar Alam,Absolutely scamming f****ers,"Absolutely scamming f****ers. I spoke to an agent regarding booking a 5 day trip to Istanbul. The mor*n told me I am getting purchase extra for free and free modifications and cancellation.  My concern was luggage price as I was only given a hand luggage. He assured me that he is an experienced advisor and I should trust him. He advised the luggage should be added via their link at lastminute.com. this will be lot cheaper than the actual Turkish Airlines. After I entered my card detail on telephone keypad, I was told their back office cannot take the payment.  I was advised to pay online, which I did. Later I checked the confirmation email which seemed off. Coz it said that I will be charged cancellation fee. And the luggage of 15kg will cost £154 one way compared to £65 for 24kg on Turkish Airlines website. This got my alarm bell on. I tried talking to the agent within 24 hours,  but I was slapped with £382 cancellation fee. They are robotic machines than human beings. Its like they are reading a script than actually listening to what you have to say. SO DON'T BOOK ANYTHING WITH THIS COMPANY. SPECIALLY DON'T BOTHER TALKING TO THEIR AGENTS.  THEY ARE INEXPERIENCED,  RUDE AND ALL THEY WANT IS YOUR MONEY. I still cancelled with them coz they aren't trust worthy.

The return trip was confirmed by lastminute.com, as I intended, for July, however in reality the flight operator performed the trip in April and lastminute.com failed to pick this up and notify me of the issue. They also failed to arrange for an alternative flight when notified of their failure. If this was not enough, they also refused to refund me for the damage created. As the purchase went through them and not directly from the flight operator, a section 75 claim (UK specific) couldn't be filed.

Ms fee,I'd give minus stars if possible,I'd give minus stars if possible.  I own a tiny Spanish house in inland Spain and last Wednesday it was broken into 3 doors busted & long story short we booked on last minute. Com on Thursday for the 18th until the 20th although the price was astronomical we had to go and decided to pay the 949.41.for 2 adults and one case . So we thought all was fine until the next morning I received a phone call from these bandits and suddenly they told me they had to add €51 pp per flight- over €200 extra for this trip . I refused to pay and my booking was cancelled.  I believe because it was blatantly obvious we HAD to go over so they decided to take full advantage of us. Apart from being upset with the break in this really was the last straw- we actually ended up getting over with Aer lingus for 208 and back with Ryan Air for €716 and this includes 2 cases .

It does NOT clearly say when booking that flights are non refundable. We cancelled booking at midnight, opened online chat with them next day after work around 2pm, to find out if we’ll get full refund or partial and if partial then can’t afford to cancel.  Was told cancellation has already been started and wait for refund option. Next day got refund option… basically they stole more than 50% of what we paid. Tried ringing them to explain that we wished to discuss cancellation before it was cancelled and was told to wait for refund option. Nothing they can do now because refund has been processed. We did not get any cooling off period and NO HELP whatsoever from agents. I will NEVER ever ever use this company again, and advise anyone else to think twice before they do!!!  This company are total scammers. They literally did not give us 24hrs before they processed the refund as this is how they make money!!!! Customer service is totally rubbish.

kamran,No check-in luggage option,"Be aware that the cheapest seat options are when sold when booking a holiday through Lastminute.com.  This means you can only carry on hand luggage, and seats cannot be upgraded or changed.  This is with Turkish airlines. Due to the ticket type sold, I discovered after I had made the booking that the cost to check in 30KG luggage is £600 extra for a round trip.  Hand luggage for a family of 4 will not be sufficient for a 7-night break.  During the booking, I asked the last-minute agent what the extra cost would be. He estimated 70 pounds.  Upon finding out about this extra cost -I immediately called Last-minute back ( within the hour), and they said I can cancel the holiday booking but would lose my money. So not really an option.  Do not use Last-minute to book a holiday since they do not provide a breakdown of the actual cost of the total holiday.  You only find out the true cost afterwards when they email you a link to check-in luggage.

I've paid £650 and checking the departure flights from the airport, the flights don't even exist. They don't have a number to call. Ryanair website in my booking area is saying ""FLIGHTS CANCELLED, sorry"".  Even on the online chat, LastMinute refuse to answer questions like 'is there a number I can call', and, 'why do these flights not exist' etc... I've been scammed, clearly. I'll chalk it down to experience but I now need to find travel for my family at short notice. My first enquiry was >£3k!",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,01 February 2023

Speaking to some one is difficult and even then they hide behind policies. I bought the insurance but actually a waste of time, because when it comes to rebooking, additional fees are charged. My main complaint is they are not very honest. I wanted to change my return journey from the Friday to the following Monday ATY-LTN. they said no flight available. However, I was able to buy a seperate ticket actually through Last Minute.Con.   Also   the flight (Wizz Air ATY-LTN  21:30) had a number of seats. Their conduct is deliberate, calculating and not at all in the interest of the customers.

Steve Ackland,Not 'Checked In' apparently,"I booked flights for 6 of us to go to Spain; all seemed easy enough. The day before the Flight, I clicked on the 'Check In' button contained within their confirmation email, checked all the names and then a big green tick appeared saying it was confirmed. The next day, at the airport, the Ryan Air check in staff said that we hadn't booked in; I explained that we had, via lastminute.com and they said that 'oh yeah, we often have issues with third party bookings'. The short version of the story was that Ryan Air refused to accept the lastminute Check In and therefore, we had to pay £330 to check in at the desk (which took literally seconds).Once back from Spain, I contacted lastminute.com 3 times and got differing stories as to why it hadn't worked and to put it bluntly, they really didn't care one bit.

None of the numbers or contact details work; I tried three times with LastMinute's chat services and told, you booked it, we can't help.  Honestly really shocking. There are so many alternatives; go with someone else.  I eventually got through to the hotel and they don't even have facilities for infants!!! This company does not give a FLYING FLIP!!

You did zero to earn that money as I was at check-in in time, the website and email took longer than the time I had left and sent me over the deadline) and now I have to try and get a refund.

This happens to be the first real break I was going to have with the girls who were extremely excited at the prospect of a relaxing trip out of the country. Now because I happened to have used last min..com to book another flight, when it came to booking this particular flight, as smart technology has it these days, it prepopulated most of the fields (except the flight section) on the screen including the dates of travel with the old information. Which on noticing this, I felt was very misleading and could potentially cause serious errors or even double booking, so changed it to the new dates. The minute I pressed the payment button, I noticed that it had reverted back to the August date that was previously there rather than the intended April date!!!! I immediately reported this, which had to be via a web chat - a BOLT most likely and almost fell over when I got presented with an updated cost of around £1000 !!! Wait for it, from the initial £200 cost. The updated cost consisted of large penalties from the change of month.Have tried to get hold a human operative to speak to, but lastmin.com just seems to be a faceless, emotionless organisation. What I’m I meant to tell my daughters now? That a computer error initiated by what we thought was an extremely reputable organisation used by many is taking away our holiday if we do not quadruple the payment?????

Lindsey Barker,Will never use this company again,Last minute.com are ok if you don’t have to change your return ticket date. Booked flexible tickets that turned out according to their unhelpful and unfriendly customer service staff to be non flexible even though I intentionally booked flexible tickets in case the return date had to be changed. Contacted them online to change return date where chat was cut off intentionally by agent called Pialy.D without solving my problem and spoke to customer service  lady called Maria on the telephone very rude. She promised that the manager would call me back in 24 hours to discuss problems. I’m still waiting. They seem to be following a script which they do not deviate from and thus going into circles.

T. Zachi,"Flight was canceled, begged for refund, but never got it","I booked a flight for 4 people through lastminute.com, almost 1000 euros. After a few days, I get an email that the flight was canceled. I went to my LM account and requested a refund, but got an error: ""something went wrong, try again later"". I tried it again for the next days, but still got the same message. So I wrote to LM by email. They fixed the apparent issue, and changed the status of my booking to ""waiting on the provider"" (KLM) for the refund. I waited for days, weeks, over a month has passed, and still no refund. In the mean time, I asked them multiple times why it was taking soo long, they replied they were waiting for the airline (KLM) to issue the refund, then they could refund me. They stated I could ""ask the provider"" to speed up the process. I asked KLM, and KLM told me they could not provide me with this info (whether they issued the refund or not), because it was the agency that booked the flight. But KLM said that I should tell them (LM) to contact KLM immediately (obviously something was wrong).I asked for proof that they contacted KLM, and guess what? They didn't give me one, but only insisted again that they were ""waiting on the provider"". More than too months passed and no refund or any proof, incredible frustrating experience!Luckily, I paid for the booking with PayPal. So I opened a dispute on the claim and escalated the issue to PayPal, providing them plenty of proof. And of course, there was no other possible outcome: PayPal closed the case in my favor and I should be getting the refund soon (thanks to PayPal).Moral of the story: never book anything through lastminute.com, never book anything through an agency with low rating, and use PayPal to pay for your booking.

sue,Dreadful experience-check the small print!,"In November 2022 I booked a ‘luxury’ holiday starting 23rd January through Lastminute.comThen, on Jan 13th, my husband had a horrible accident and we were told that on no account should he fly for 6-8 weeks. On 16th January, we requested cancellation (or postponement) from Lastminute.com and  forwarded the reports from A&E and our doctor. Although our insurance company were sympathetic, they could do nothing until LM formally documented the situation over our holiday. I frequently contacted LM via live chat to try to expedite the cancellation process and was repeatedly told they were waiting to hear back from the provider about our refund!Our booking was still appearing on LM’s website 11 days after our request to cancel and there hadn’t been any formal cancellation notification. This was later confirmed via live chat after several requests. One email stated (verbatim): “We inform you that as per your request. As we checked in our system the relevant team is working on your refund request. We request you please wait to get an update. Once we get an update we will update you as soon as possible via email.”  They did not. Despite re-reading LM’s terms and conditions, we had no idea how much we would be refunded. Finally, I asked a live chat Agent which ‘provider’ they were waiting to hear from about the ‘refund’ they had referred to during each communication. After 2 weeks of asking, I was eventually told that we were not entitled to any refund whatsoever! I’m still shocked, but now scrutinising the terms and cons LM sent after receiving our deposit I see that the Savoy hotel contract entitles them to keep the entire cost of the stay from the very day it was booked!! So, a hard lesson, and I hope this will alert others.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,16 January 2023

So I can't even imagine how they would have treated me to my face!! All I wanted was an apology for ruining my birthday stay, but no, not even an apology I receivedSo PLEASE be warned of this hotel. I definitely will never be staying at ANY other XO hotel around Amsterdam - I will just book with another brand. Should not be labelling themselves as a 4-star hotel as the way they treat you is classed as 1 or 2 star. Only good thing I have to stay are that the rooms are well renovated and it is good location.

They came back next morning to tell me that they couldn't confirm my booking so I should try again. So, I did and then few hours later the same result.

Martin Bailey,Flights booked from London to Sydney…,"Flights booked from London to Sydney with a layover in LA. The flights where with Virgin Atlantic with the connecting flights from LAX to SYD and back to LA by Delta Airlines.I got an email from lastminute.com stating the LAX to SYD flight had been cancelled by the airline and to contact them to reschedule or get a refund.I contacted VA as it was their flight (supported by Delta). VA customer services stated they couldn't see the reason for the cancellation so speak to lastminute.com, the guy at VA wasn't even sure there was a cancellation.I went back to lastminute.com and insisted they find another flight if this flight is cancelled, they said they would get back to me within 7 days.I then thought I'd check on the Delta website to see if there was any info there to help me figure out what was going on, the Delta site stated the booking had been rescheduled 5 minutes early, so I called Delta and they confirmed that the flight had been changed to a 5 min earlier time but I was safe on that flight and all my seats are as booked.I went back to lastminute.com and told them not to cancel anything and explained what had happened but they told me too late they've cancelled the entire round trip booking but they cant tell me when I'd get a refund as its down to the airline.... like they wouldn't know each airlines refund policy, I found both within a couple of minutes.In short, because a flight was rescheduled by 5 minutes they decided to cancel the entire 4 flight booking! Utterly utterly disgusted and in total disbelief.... I've now no flights and no money to rebook....  Yet both Virgin Atlantic and Delta still show my tickets as live and both customer service staff have confirmed they also see my tickets as still live and booked. So lastminute.com don't actually have to do anything, don't cancel anything, just leave everything as it was.What an absolutely stressful, horrid and unnecessary experience.UPDATE: After some perseverance I was contacted buy a top guy called George from the VIP team based in the London office. Between the two of us we gained an understanding of what had happened and why and found a solution. I was really pleased with his approach, he showed empathy and understanding with a clear aim to resolve the matter and find a solution, he called me when he said he would and kept me informed with his progress, despite employees in other departments based abroad making serious mistakes ( I think they just really didn't care about their jobs or the impact on people lives) that undone George's great work, he managed to get the obvious logical solution back on track and currently I have a new flight booked a few hours early than my original from Heathrow allowing for a longer layover in L.A, and the three other flights in the full return journey remained the same and not cancelled.I really appreciate George's efforts as the original experience caused a lot of stress for me and my family. There is still a little bit of anxiety as it's a couple of months to go before our flight and we hope there isn't another mess up, but so far so good.Thank you George, I hope you are recognised by your peers for your great use of logic, human empathy and understand and your positive solution finding attitude, excellent customer service, great work! Thank you!This single individual is a complete contrast from the attitude and actions of other employees in other departments include the members of the live chat team and the Asia office.In light of my negative experience that gained an original one star, I now change my rating of lastminute.com to 3 stars, I rate George a 5 star as he put in the work but other departments let the side down so balancing out with a 3 star overall. If all goes well I may increase to a 4 star after my trip.",Rated 3 out of 5 stars,23 January 2023

Arif,The worst hotel I have stayed in…,Not sure if it was directly your company but booking holidays the hotel should look after your clients! My room was on the ground floor above the main kitchen where they were making all the food including breakfast buffet in the middle of the night and all I could hear was the whole kitchen banging! I complaint to the hotel to move my room but they decline and said they don’t have any room which wasn’t true! My flight was late and I requested if I could check out late and without even checking the reception staff said straightaway no we can’t and I have to check it this morning!

Terry Wake,Holiday to Benidorm,"The holiday and the hotel were amazing and can't wait to go back.The journey out to our destination with easyJet was very good as I've used them before and am always very happy with themHowever our return trip with Ryanair wasn't as good, for some reason our luggage that was ok size wise going out, wasn't, coming back and we were stung to the amount of almost £100 for two small cabin sized bags and they had to go in the hold, but walking to our seats on the plane toward the back and looking in the overhead lockers they were ALL choc a block with luggage much larger than our cases so we wouldn't have had space anyway.I've always heard bad reviews regarding Ryanair and now we've experienced it ourselves I think it would be best if you dropped Ryanair as one of your carriers as when we book our return trip and if I see we're required to travel either way on Ryanair again I may have to rethink a return holiday",Rated 4 out of 5 stars,19 January 2023

Rolls Rolls Rolls,HORRENDOUS SERVICE.,"HORRENDOUS SERVICE.My flight was due in 18th of January 2023.Had an emergency thing to deal, so I had to cancel and rebook my flight. I first called the airline outside 24 hour policy and responded to me, saying it wasn't in their control to do it but the agency itself. Then, I contacted the agency both by chat and phone. In the chat conversation it was very clear that I intended to cancel my flight. Thereafter, the agency called me to confirm the cancellation and asked me to click the link they sent in my email to confirm the cancellation and rebooking. As I did so, the agent told me that my request was already confirmed. They even sent me email that my flight was indeed cancelled and also stating that it needs up to four (4) days to finalise my new ticket. The only next step is to pay the rebooking charges. Then, on 18th of January, the day my flight is due. I spoke again with this agency. To realise that they made a terrible mistake by not really cancelling my flight. And they were saying, my ticket is already considerered as  NO SHOW. And they were saying that I lost my ticket.They dont want to rebook me any further as my ticket is overdue in their opinion.Then, I contacted the airline, and I showed the evidence that I cancelled my flight from this agency. Then, the airline advise was I should ask the agency for a refund, if they cant do it, the airline is willing to assist them to issue the refund as my ticket is considered as not a NO SHOW TICKET by the airline.But this bandit agency doesnt want to cooperate even if I told them to report them to local authority in UK.DONT USE THIS AGENCY...This ticketing agency is without BUSINESS ETHICS, NO MORAL, CARELESS & A LIAR.They shouldnt be in this kind of field.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,17 January 2023

We had a hotel booking but needed to cancel due to an unexpected medical situation. Despite the hotel very kindly agreed for us to cancel with no penalty considering the reason of cancellations, customer service operators refused to provide any support, despite us mentioning the fact that the hotel has agreed to not place charges. The operator was not only unhelpful but also kept pushing in the conversation for us to accept full penalty. After trying different operators (do not give up on trying), one of them finally agreed to request cancellation and the refund was processed. The whole experience of contacting their customer service was very frustrating overall, on top of the already quite stressful medication situation that we have.

Dazza D,One of the worst companies I have dealt…,"One of the worst companies I have dealt with. False advertising. Take money without you knowing.  I booked a holiday with Booking.com with flights as advertised on tv. Without me realising it diverts you through to lastminute.com. picked the flights and hotel and proceed to book. Unusually it asked for a deposit for 6 months time and it also stated free cancellation on the page until a month before. On telling friends what I had booked they explained that it isn't the same as the room as Booking.com. I proceed to cancel within two hours and rebook with Booking.com. I then received emails stating that I would be charged £1100. Compensation and a plan for the rest of the holiday. Unable to speak to anyone but managed to get a chat started, she stated I have broken T&Cs item 7 and it is Compensation for the suppliers. When I asked what suppliers she closed the chat. Flights were £550 and all of the websites state accommodation is free cancellation even on the hotel website. Started another chat the next day and was told that they do not cancel flights as they are budget airlines. The airline states if flights are cancelled within 24hours there is minimal charges. So far I have had no updates and still have the flights in my name on the airline website. They are still planning to take more money out of the bank. Informed the bank not to pay. In the T&Cs it states a minimum of 20% deposit will be taken but funnily they only took £50 so they have broken their own T&Cs but that's okay for them to do it. Be very careful people they are a very deceiving company. Watch what you sign up for and the other thing, if you book through booking.com! They do not do flights as part of the package they outsource it to other companies. Really disappointed with booking.com for allowing this to happen to customers.

I had to get new bookings and pay personally.As cancelation wasn't an option ( I'd have to pay a fee), I didn't cancel thinking I could provide the new booking at a later date to receive a refund.This wasn't the case.",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,11 November 2022

Mrs Ruth Kirby,Don't book with LM.com,"Booked a family 'package' holiday to Zante for Summer 23 which included flights & 4 star hotel on HB basis.  24 hours later I was told that the hotel I had booked was no longer available (due to a technical hitch) and I was offered an alternative which I did not accept.  I was offered another and another but they're still not up to the same standard as my original booking, so I asked to cancel the holiday and I was told that I have to keep the flights and the balance to be deducted for the hotel penalises me for cancelling it - not because I wanted to.  I am so upset with this and I don't even know if we have a holiday at all now.  I do not recommend Lastminute.com as they don't seem to show the true availability of hotels at the time of booking.

Sarah Wyatt,If I could leave 0 stars I would!,"If I could leave 0 stars I would!! Absolutely appalling customer service - DO NOT USE THIS ONLINE TRAVEL AGENCY SITE. I wish I had read the other reviews before entrusting them with our booking.  Firstly, after our airline cancelled one of the flights from our 4-leg trip lastminute.com contacted us to advise us to arrange an alternative flight directly with the airline as ""it is the airline's responsibility"".  After being informed by the airline that as we booked with an Agent, only the agent can request the alternative flight on our behalf and once the Agent had been in touch they were happy to do this.  I then informed lastminute.com of the response from the airline and they then agreed to do this on our behalf!  The following day we received an email from lastminute.com informing us that now all 4 of our flights had been cancelled! After an hour spent on the Customer Chat with 2 useless members of staff I finally got hold of someone I could speak to.  They took no responsibility at all, said they had tried to arrange alternative flights but the airline had none available - this was despite me being on the airline's website simultaneously and could see that all 4 flights were available!!  To be lied to continuously by 3 members of staff is completely unacceptable, they all refused to take any responsibility or to take their duty to a customer seriously and were happy for me to try to resolve the issue myself.  To top it all, I was informed that if I request a refund, I may have to wait up to 2 months for the refund and that any refund will be minus £25 per person (£50 in our case) for admin fees in handling our refund - you can't make it up!!  Total joke of a company - luckily we are in a position to source alternative flights and pay for them whilst we wait for our refund - not everyone can do this. They have no compassion towards customers who may not be able to pay for alternative flights without the refund being made.  I can only imagine the stress that this would cause people, I am stressed enough after spending half of my day dealing with them! I cannot say one good thing about my experience with lastminute.com and I will NEVER use them again for any reason!!",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,13 January 2023

Paul,Here's a headscratcher...,"Here's a headscratcher... on the whole, online travel agents are great for bookings when things go well. When things don't, however, they all become a bit too reliant on hiding behind Ts&Cs that no one reads and the scripts they give to customer service agents. I expect it... But Lastminute.com has added one step that's truly baffled me. I booked a flight, long haul. The price was ok (not the cheapest but the alternatives were less well known). However, there was no option to add baggage... the wording says, ""you can add baggage once your booking has been confirmed"". No prices, no details, just nothing.So, wait.... I have to make a booking BEFORE I find out how much the baggage is going to cost? Surely not...??What happens if my budget doesn't allow for the baggage cost? Do I go on holiday without any trousers? The last button in the process says, ""review and pay"". I thought this might give me a breakdown of what I am paying for but nope. It just takes your money. I called to ask about it and this was the result:I cannot cancel the booking (even though the booking has not been confirmed). They cannot tell me how much the baggage is going to cost. It's going to take 3 or 4 DAYS to give me a price. After which, I can accept or refuse... but either way, the flight booking remains. The reason? no idea. They spoke about their ""systems"" and ""terms and conditions"" but the reality is, the agent didn't know what they were talking about, they were just reciting whatever script they had. I'm not even sure they knew the layout of their own website. Their job must be so tough with all this nonsense they're given to blindly tell us. Every other agent gave me the price of baggage. Weird.

TNC,Please don't use them whatever you do,"The whole experience was a disaster, how I wish I'd read these reviews before booking with them.First they cancelled our booking because the airline had cancelled the flight, which is fair enough. But you'd think if the company cancels the booking themselves, they'd initiate the refund process too. Nope, we had to do that for them.So I rebooked the trip from a different airport and requested a refund for the original trip that they'd cancelled, and they mistakenly cancelled our second trip and refunded that instead. So I had to speak to a few people until I made them understand I actually want to keep the second booking, and they eventually managed to send the refund for the original booking that they'd cancelled.We'd only paid the deposit initially with the rest of the balance to be cleared at a later date. When that date came, I noticed that the outstanding balance hadn't come out of our account. So I went to check the account and couldn't find any way to pay the rest of the balance, and they hadn't taken the money themselves either, so I got in touch with them. The agent I spoke to via chat told me twice that there is no outstanding balance. I double checked, I asked are you sure?? and he said yes, there's no outstanding balance. I have the chat transcript to show that. On our booking online there was absolutely no way in which I could pay the outstanding balance manually.So I thought I'll keep an eye on it to see if anyone gets in touch later or any money comes out of the account, maybe there was a mixup. Worst case we get a cheaper holiday, right? Well about a week later I get a call in evening, which I miss as I was getting dinner ready, when trying to call back I can't get through, I google the number and see it was lastminute. I get on chat with them to see if there was any important message they meant to give me about the booking, and it was, it was them calling to get the rest of the payment.Bear in mind I haven't received any email communication since to say there's a balance outstanding, they just rang out of the blue - imagine getting your credit card out and paying money to whoever calls you in the evening saying they're from lastminute, right?On chat I was told it was them trying to get payment, and they confirmed the balance outstanding too, which was what I knew it to be, so they ask me to ring back on a number they gave me, which I did. I ring and try to find my way through the answer machine maze and eventually I speak to a person, who tells me that yes, there is a balance outstanding, but I have to wait to be called back because they can't process the payment if I call them (???) no explanation given as to why.So I'm starting to find this all a bit dubious and go back to the chat to confirm what I was just told on the phone, and yes, despite having been told minutes before to ring myself to make payment, I was now told that I have to wait to be rung back, at their convenience, and I should just keep my phone next to me indefinitely so I don't miss them. This is after they told me a week before that there was no balance outstanding.No one's called me yet and I have no clue when they're planning on calling back, but I have to pay close attention to my phone and make myself available at any time of night and day because lastminute will even make you work to give them money.Plus the person on chat was very rude and impatient with me after I tried to make them understand what my frustrations have been with lastminute and why I can't understand how they run their company this way.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,11 January 2023

When I told the lady on the phone how I was annoyed as I had been left waiting her response was ""yeah well I've got other customers waiting so don't keep me waiting for them too"" They simply did not care.

They are still available! Only difference is they had gone up in price.Call to cancel, then I'm told I may not get a refund or may have to pay for the hotel cancellation.Now this hol was booked on the 9th of December, why would the hotel be reserved when the flights are not even booked?? In fact why not reserve the flights 5 weeks ago when it was booked?Come on guys, seriously, a total an utter joke. I wouldn't mind but the attitude and robot like responses when you call are epic.

Matt,Terrible experience - will never use service again,"Their service seems helpful at first glance (live chat support during biz hours, flexible insurance plan, etc.) but the limitations can really destroy your plans if you need to change anything after the initial booking.We submitted 4 change requests only to find out 14 days after the initial request that our booking was ineligible for changes and our only option was to cancel our original ticket, collect 90% of ticket value from FullFlex plan, and rebook new tickets. During this wait the price of the new flight doubled. Other issues:- Flight was delayed but we were never contacted about the change, and our flight time in the lastminute app never updated to match the current departure time (even after takeoff).- Not all flight options were available to book with voucher. Certain flight options were found on Google Flights did not exist for booking within Lastminute.com search (forcing us to pay for other more expensive routes with our voucher)- Booking change requests are sent to a team and responded to within 4 days, but you are unable to talk to this team live to discuss options. If request is denied for any reason (getting error from airline, time not available, etc.) your ticket is closed and must submit new ticket with another 1-4 day wait.- Requests were denied with little/no explanation on why. Agents on phone were not able to help with making changes live. We requested a callback from the team that handles the actual changes numerous times and never received a call. I suspect they are critically understaffed in this department and only have agents to receive requests/complaints, but not to help solve requests.- Customer support not open 24 hours, so while travelling in Asia were unable to discuss booking issues until 8am UK time.- Supervisor/manager team is completely blocked off. Support team on phone refused to connect us with supervisors or other team which could help address issues live. This is critical when looking to make changes impacting an itinerary within 2-5 days of departure.

The Numbers Game of LastMinute,"One of my principles in  life and business is to give a person or business an opportunity to correct a mistake before making an issue of it. You find that good companies will often 'over deliver' in rectifying their problem, which only adds to the credibility and strength as a brand in my eyes.However, when - despite admitting responsibility - the business refuses to discuss the issue other than through a 'chatline', with their last comment being ""If you wish to cancel your flight now it will be considered a voluntary cancellation and the refund depends upon the airline policy"", my patience and goodwill have finally evaporated.It would be nice for lastminute.com to finally make a 'phone call, but I do not hold out much hope, despite emailing the county manager and CEO. They simply don't care about customers; it's all a numbers game to them.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,03 January 2023

Kevin Mathieson,Dreadful Customer Service,"The sign of a good company is how they respond when things go wrong. On that basis LastMinute.Com should score zero. I booked flights through them and afterwards the airline phoned to say that one of the legs had been cancelled and they had told LM.Com. I waited more than a week but heard nothing and then tried to call but got bounced around, kept waiting and several times had the call terminated on me when I was just starting to speak to someone. I then went online to see if I could use their chat portal but it wasn't working.

Christina Spencer,Could not give a cr@p about their customers,"Booked flight and hotel package in Paris, only to turn up and front doors are padlocked shut, no staff to be seen inside. Lastminute customer service insisted it was open and told me to collect keys from 1 hour away. They insist it was all explained to me prior but it wasn’t. I did not have time for all this on what was only a 2 night stay and I booked this apart-hotel instead of an air bnb because I wanted a 24-7 receptionist as described in the particulars so I could leave my luggage before check in/after check out. Tbh at the time it all screamed “scam”. I had to pay £400 for another hotel. On return I applied for a refund and have been refused several times. I have researched tirelessly and discovered the hotel was closing down at the time and was being managed by another company, hence them holding the keys. There was no receptionist/daily breakfast/gym as had been advertised, only individual apartments. Now the hotel IS completely closed. Lastminute are not accepting ANY responsibility for advertising a hotel that was officially closed and was temporarily being run under another name, without any of the facilities advertised and I am £400 out of pocket. Had their staff been more knowledgeable and been able to give me more information on the day OR just give me alternative accommodation I would have made do. My credit card company agree they are in the wrong and still they refuse to give a refund. I recommend everyone avoid this company like they plague, they are just a search engine for other accommodation agencies to advertise through and therefore their staff have zero interest in helping their customers.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,27 September 2022

Jakebrowno,Avoid at all costs!,"We had booked a flight with lastminute.com a year ago, which was cancelled. We decided to take the voucher (which expired within 1 year). We just went to book a new flight, and the box for a discount code simply would not appear. I spoke to their customer service team who advised a member of the sales team would call me. 24 hours later and no phonecall so I rang the sales team. After a long back and forth confirming details I was offered a deal that was a full £50+ more expensive (~£177) than the deal I had infant of me online (~£122). When I questioned this she stated this was the live price and the website was incorrect, she was dealing directly with Ryanair and her price was final. When I checked Ryanair's website, it was £138. I challenged this again and she simply shouted over me, stating that this was the price. I then asked why there was a discount applied online which was not being applied over the phone, again she simply shouted there would be no discount available. She then informed me that I would only use either the travel credit (~£140) OR the £10 gift card they offered us for cancellation, not both (so that was a wasted exercise anyway, should have taken the cash!!). At this point she rudely pushed me whether I wanted to continue or not, I politely declined. Upon loading the website up again in a new private browser, the discount code appeared and worked no problems. We booked the flight (that was apparently the wrong price and not possible to honour) with no problems at all. Would avoid lastminute.com (especially their sales team) at all costs.

Elaine Walsh,Stay away from lastminute.com  Do not book with this company,"We booked our holiday through lastminute.com to stay at the Goldenday Wings, Kusadasi, Turkey, from September 22nd to October 1st 2022. It was the filthiest hotel we ever stayed in. The smell in our bathroom was so bad you could smell it coming up the corridor to our room, it was a leak under the shower which had been leaking for a very long time i'd say, the smell of damp was vile and the bathroom was like a lake if we tried to take a shower, we had to place multiple towels on the floor to take the leaking water from the shower tray. We had no top sheets on the bed, we were given towels for top sheets. The hallways/corridors were littered with black sacks of rubbish, laundry and the paint / plaster was falling off the walls in places. At the hotel bar/restaurant and pool area, the tables, chairs, parasols, pool and pool tiles were beyond filthy. There was mold and mildew everywhere. We complained many times but the management of the hotel were so unprofessional, there really was no point. The management & staff would congregate at the entrance to the hotel and smoke right at the front entrance, us, the clients/residents had to pass plumes of secondhand smoke upon exiting / entering the hotel. I can safely say it was the worst holiday experience of our lives and the tour operator have been of absolutely no assistance to us at all (lastminute.com), we feel like we have been robbed of our hard earned money (€2,130). We were lucky we had family in the area at the time so we stayed a couple of nights with them. We are still getting nowhere with the tour operator, they are trying to say we never contacted them while we were over there, but we did, through their site and then eventually by phone, we will never use lastminute.com again, they want to refund us €76!!!! And lastminute.com have have stopped conversing with us!  While we were still over there in Turkey, we learned that the hotel was the subject of a legal battle between owner and renting tenant. Lastminute.com have taken the Goldenday Wings Hotel off their site, a bit little too late for us!

Colin Avis,AVOID! They will screw you over,"We booked flights through last minute to Vegas for Christmas and New Year. Flights out went fine and all of the start of our trip was perfect! THEN the journey home begins… our first flight from vegas to LA (American Airlines) with a connecting flight from LA to Dublin with Aer Lingus. DELAYED 5 hours… plane was at the gate for hours but they were fixing a spring in the tail fin at the gate. Initially contacted Aer Lingus as all of our booking information was supplied by them. Told that because we didn’t book direct with them that we have to contact lastminute.com. Head onto lastminute.com to find their “part time” customer service is closed!So forced to seek help from American Airlines (not a company I would ever chose to use) they re arranged our flights so we would be flying to Heathrow and then back out to dublin, meaning we would miss our connecting flight from dublin to Bristol to get home. finally the plane was fixed, we all boarded, and flew to LA. Further delays taking off and arriving to the gate meant we missed the Heathrow flight. Again had to seek help from American Airlines as our travel agent is CLOSED. Rebooked for a flight to Heathrow, forced to stay in LA for the night and now having to organise a train back to Bristol at our expense. After nearly 12 hours of travelling we arrive at our overnight stay. This morning contact lastminute.com (our travel agent) and told we have to contact the airline as they are unable to help! Happy to sell the package, happy to take our money, but that’s where the happiness ends. No customer care, no help!Contact the airlines, again told as we booked through lastminute that we had to speak to them. Feels like everyone is passing the buck and lying to us.We are now facing a long haul flight home, seated separately (wife is a nervous flier and 3 months pregnant - all airlines and last minute have been told this) a day of unpaid work due to the delays, £170 flight from dublin to Bristol missed and lost, £97 train home out of our own pockets.NEVER EVER USE LASTMINUTE.comThey take your money and the customer experience abruptly ends there.We have learnt our lesson the hard way but I do hope this review will help other potential customers to avoid being treated like this.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,01 January 2023

The central heating was completely turned off and only way to heat the room was one tiny oil heater covered with dust. Off course, it took long time to heat and in the end, it was not enough to heat entire room. So we went down to the reception to ask an extra heater. First, they gave us a broken heater, so we had to go down again to ask another one...Only one bath towel was provided for each person and they did not even provide bath mat, so we had to use one of our towels on the bath room floor.We were hoping to take at least nice & hot shower, but the shower head was clogged with limescale, so the water coming out of the head was either very hot or cold ( repeating very hot and cold).You can hear the noise of cars passing in front of the hotel so loud, as if the windows were open, so we struggled to sleep.The concierge/receptionist didn't even know how to get to the Kensington Palace...Obviously this hotel did not worth £92/night.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,16 December 2022

There is a clear lack of transparency and this is a rogue behavior. As my credit card is in AED, I ended up paying AED 1,886.53 which is AED 80.45 higher than the price I agreed to pay. Lastminute.com is a dishonest merchant and should always be avoided. I will never use this website to book my travel again.

Izzy,DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY,"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. ALWAYS BOOK DIRECT.Truly atrocious. 1. Last minute offered us a flight which we accepted when our booked flight was cancelled  - they then put us on a different flight that they had originally offered and we originally declined. I had to call, email and ‘chat’ countless times to first apply to get the flight changed to the correct one, and then to PROVE that this flight still existed as lastminute was claiming this flight no longer existed, despite the fact that I could see it live and Bookable on the airline website. Calling is impossible- waiting for ages only to be hung up on and told bluntly ‘there is nothing we can do/this flight does not exist/you are wrong’ when finally getting through to a human instead of a robot. Website chat with undeniable preprepared evidence to fight your case is the only way to get through to them.Finally the flight I wanted was accepted (aka the flight they offered!!) and the flight was corrected.2. I had booked myself checked luggage - this showed up on lastminute website but lastminute failed to notify the airline, so my airline ticket showed I had no checked or cabin baggage - this was for there and back. Each time, I had to persuade the airline that I had the correct ticket by showing the lastminute booking and invoice, and explaining the situation to them - they could have easily refused and charged me for checked, thankfully they didn’t.  3. The nail in this wonderful coffin - the airline changed the return flight destination from Heathrow to Stansted on 3rd December. Airline confirmed that they notified lastminute of this change well in advance of flight date (17dec). Lastminute failed to update our tickets to the new flight destination, so our tickets were INVALID. I tried checking in day before online - wouldn’t let me - so when I went to do it at the airport I was informed the tickets were wrong, but they couldn’t tell me why. It took me a while to work out the error, and again, I had to beg lastminute over website chat to update the tickets to the correct flight destination - meanwhile our window to check in was swiftly closing. It took countless chats and once again, irrefutable evidence of the change in destination, for them to bother doing anything. Multiple times I was told I was wrong and the flight destination had not changed. I was at the airport and could witness with my own eyes on the board that my flight was heading to Stansted! I had to get the airline to confirm directly that they had informed lastminute of this change. Finally they agreed to correct the tickets. It took over an hour (not including all the time it took trying to get through to them and explaining over and over again what the issue was). We managed to check in with about 20 minutes to spare - this is when we arrived at the airport 4 hours early. Had we arrived 3 hours early (the usual time), we would not have made it, and it would have been lastminutes fault. Lastminute continually attempted to gaslight me throughout this, telling me it was the airlines fault and responsibility, in the same way they tried to pretend the flight I accepted had been cancelled despite it being live on the airline website. If we missed our flight, we would have been stranded for the night (next flight 11am next morning and over £120 each) or I’d have had to fork out over £600 for replacement tickets. No apology was issued for any of this stress. No solution was offered for being left potentially stranded, such as hotel or rebooking us free of charge. Will book direct with airline always.

Any complaints to the customer service resulted in being referred to terms and conditions (without even getting pointed to the right clause in the terms and conditions). They say that it is the airline that decides the refund amount, however, i know that the airline in question sells fares which are non refundable. So i do not understand why lastminute.com decided to accept my refund request and then issue me with a 70 euro voucher.Anyways whatever you do, do not click on the refund button because it will result in you automatically losing your reservation and money.

I asked for help as they had booked the flights. They told me the flight had not been cancelled. I checked on the airlines website to see it no longer there. The chat basically relinquished all responsibility and told me to email proof of cancellation to “customer service” no offer to help to get alternative flight. Thank god we managed to get an earlier flight direct (eventually) through the airline. Today received an email from last minute that said as we have contacted the airline directly to try to sort this issue as they were no help they are no longer responsible for the booking.

Matt Kissell,"Worst travel agent out there, do not book with them if you want peace of mind!","Lastminute.com have to be quite frankly the worst travel agent I have ever had to book with. I booked a trip with some friends to go to Norway early December this year and what should have been simple requests turned out to be complete incompetence on their side. I changed my name on the booking (to which I recognise was my mistake) a month or two before my trip, they originally wanted to charge me £600 for two name changes, but I argued that the airline penalty was way lower than that, thankfully they realised they were providing a figure that was unrealistic. When lastminute.com changed this for me, it removed all luggage on my booking. I called them up to get it sorted and they said they would look into it, every time they did not fix this issue. I had to call them up nearly everyday 3 weeks before my trip to demand I get my luggage (which I paid for 4-5 months before) on each passenger correctly. A day before my first flight, they emailed saying they couldn't add it on and that I would have to pay for my luggage again and get reimbursed, the cheek on them!Luckily, I found a helpful member at Gatwick who added our luggage on for free on our outbound flights, but we had to pay for luggage on the way back. I have now received my reimbursement but they still messed that up, falling a little short than the clear evidence I sent them, but not enough to warrant wasting anymore time on trying to get them to provide a decent level of customer support!The amount of stress, panic and inconvenience lastminute.com gave me for my trip, I will never be purchasing a holiday from them again.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,01 December 2022

Harry Webb,If only I'd taken more notice of the negative reviews!,"The initial booking for a long weekend in Tromso, Norway, seemed to go OK. Then the troubles started big time. I was advised the return flight was being changed to an unacceptable time. Their so called Customer Care is atrocious, abysmal and basically useless. I recorded a time line of events when the return flight was again changed and eventually gave up after 11 (yes eleven) flight changes and never once did Lastminute.com call me to discuss anything to suit, simply advising of the latest change. I finally asked them to cancel only the return flight and that I would arrange my own but this took five weeks after they assumed I wanted to cancel everything. I easily arranged our return flight via the same airline (SAS) and on the very flight Lastminute.com had first booked and claimed needed changing at the direction of SAS. My direct booking with SAS was completely successful and took only 20 minutes. There were a total of in excess of 30 (yes thirty) communications related to the return flight alone. I have these available for any scrutiny. Finding a Customer Care phone number is difficult to find (it's 020 8396 1129 for anyone looking). Additionally, an email requesting the details of a senior executive to complain to was basically refused saying all complaints had to be handled through Lastminute.com Customer Care, thus meaning they act as their own judge and jury. We went on the weekend and until we'd booked into our chosen hotel in Tromso was I confident we'd have a room. Even my final invoice didn't match what I'd actually paid but by then I'd almost lost the will to live and didn't bother trying to get the odd 40 quid back.If only trustpilot had a facility to give zero stars. Please, please, if this review can save just one person from the experiences of a totally unreliable agent then this review will have been worthwhile. Where a booking goes through from A to Z okay then probably there will be a decent review BUT where a booking like ours falls foul then please don't say I didn't warn you!",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,02 December 2022

Robert,the hotel Karnak was nothing like in the picture reviews.,"The pictures in the reviews was nothing like what we got drapes hanging of NO HOT WATER FOR THE FIVE DAYS WE STAYED THERE. We complained about no hot water from day one and to everyone we saw , and was told is would be fixed. Every time we asked for the manager we were told he was busy. Breakfast was cheese tomato pita bread asked juice  and was given a small bottle of water between us asked about dinner was told kitchen was closed would not be opened till weekend. Pool was full of stagnant water, was told pump was getting repaired. The SUN only got to poolside 2 hours a day between 10am and 12am , so no sunbathing, after 5 nights we went to reception told reception we were checking out and wanted to see the manager, was told he would be there in 30mins. We waited 1 hour still no manager, we got a taxi to the St Joseph Hotel. The owner said he would give us B/B for 9 nights for £300. At the Karnak we had to go to the Hilton hotel (across the road) where the pool attendant let us use the pool facilities for a large tip. We were able to wash and bath and shave. We are both over 70 years of age and in all our visits worldwide  the Karnak must be the worst hotel we have ever encountered. I have some photos of the room and pool (only three lilos same towels on them for the 5 days we were there) but because I could not get wifi or a charging points in the room I was limited to what I could get. Also no one could speak or understand English properly. In my opinion I think that I should be refunded the money that I had to pay the other hotel which was a godsend to us, and some other form of compensation for the 5 nights we spent in HELL. I could go on and on about this place but the more we think about it the more upset we get. Yours Mr Robert",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,21 November 2022

I wouldn't recommend on this basis - but winter sun was much appreciated.",Rated 3 out of 5 stars,01 December 2022

Both were subject to significant delays, with the return journey departing around two and a half hours after its scheduled takeoff time. We were kept at the Heathrow crowded departure gate for what seemed an endless amount of time and not entirely unsurprisingly, I found out two days later that I had contracted Covid.

It was incredibly small, i.e could not walk around the bed as shown in the pictures, you'd have to climb over someone if you were 2 people sharing. The room itself was clean. However, it was tired, the TV and internet did not work during my stay, and I was asked to vacate my room early due to a cleaner needing access for the next guests. Access to the room should be described more clearly in the marketing. Navigating several flights of very narrow stairs with luggage on my own was incredibly difficult and it didn't feel safe to leave my belongings at the bottom to collect the bits I couldn't carry in one go. To be clear I am very fit and healthy but this was no easy task! The entrance was covered in vomit, and the noise levels from other guests was loud.

Arj,The worst experience of my life,"The worst experience of my life. I made a booking this morning and I specifically selected the option to cancel any time for free, up until a couple of days before the holiday. Lastminute happily took a £70 deposit from my account. I then realised I booked the wrong flights (departure and return airports were different) and so within 30 minutes I made a new booking in which I got charged £70 deposit straight away for the new booking. I cancelled the original one straight away. Bearing in mind the holiday dates are for Feb 2023, so it is still sometime away. Later on this evening, I get randomly charged £111.68 for the original booking telling me it's a cancellation fee?! I spoke to someone on live chat who fobbed me off repeating themselves with the generic messages, saying how the £111.68 cancellation fee is correct repeating themselves, they then cut me off when I asked to speak to a manager. I tried again and got through to someone else on live chat and they gave me an email address to contact, so frustrating. They are just theifs, no sympathy whatsoever and their agents on live chat respond like robots with no hearts. I'm still trying to obtain my money back and I'm sure they won't. Why give an option to cancel your booking at any time before hand for free, to then turn around and charge me. Their excuse was the hotel cancellation was free but the flight incurred cancellation charges, complete scam of a company. Even when I tried to contact them pleading to refund this as I cancelled the original booking within 30 mins of putting it through, they are fobbing me off. If a day or days had passed then I understand but the fact I cancelled within the hour of when I placed the original booking and they still charged me £111.68 is a joke. 100% recommended everyone to stay away or use Tui they are much more transparent. Lastminute falsely advertise a free cancellation option at a cheaper rate, only to then charge you if you do utilise this option. Complete scam. Horrible, horrible experience overall.

Anonymous,NEVER EVER WITH LASTMINUTE.,"Apart from the initial booking, the travel agent did not bother to do anything. All this in spite of taking the flexible package. The connecting flight was cancelled and this information was sent while I was in the previous flight. There was no refund provided even after waiting for 9 months. No updates and even when enquired standard response - in progress. unless you are sure that you are ready to risk and sure not to take any support from Lastminute.com.

(Flying 16.12 Heathrow to BGY on Aeroitalia XZ1112) Refund will take a long period of up to 2 months. I kept asking call centre. I received a confirmation email.I was worried so kept asking lastminute.com that I can't find any more tickets being sold for flights or track flight numbers either. Lastminute.com kept reassuring me that the flight is confirmed. You can check this on the last 3 chats. Aeroitalia company I was flying with sent me another PNR number after repeated emails. I couldn't manage my booking and asked them again. They said they are having an issue with their website. I will be able to buy additional services at the airport.I checked on their website no tickets were sold for 16.12 Heathrow to BGY. I asked lastminute and they reassured me that all tickets might have been sold out. I got this information of cancellation on repeated requests. Almost I questioned this 4 or 5 times. This company hasn't even started a single flight to London yet but still selling tickets. Please beware of Aeroitalia Heathrow to BGY -,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,07 December 2022

Giles Gailer,"Paid for hotel, not booked despite LM sending confirmation","Arrived in Krakow, Friday evening, snowing only to discover the hotel I'd booked (and had had confirmed by Lastminute) didn't have any record of the booking and was fully booked.Tried customer support, they said they would respond within 24 hours and ended the conversation. Leaving us in Krakow with no accommodation. Lastminute could have booked us into a different hotel, this would have solved all the issues. Instead, they did nothing. I had to source a new hotel, I had to chase Lastminute, I'm still having to chase Lastminute.If booking through lastminute, I recommend you email or call your hotel ahead of time to confirm your booking. Lastminute can NOT be trusted to have booked/confirmed your room. I will update this review following feedback from the Lastminute ""investigation"".EDIT 07/12/22 - Having not received confirmation that lastminute received my report and invoices, I chased them for feedback. Turns out they have received my report and this may take 28 days to complete their investigation. Shame they didn't work as hard on sorting out my accommodation.EDIT 20/12/22 - I've now received confirmation that Lastminute are refunding me the cost of the extra accommodation and breakfast. However, they aren't paying for the accommodation that I didn't get. Can't help but feel a little like I've been robbed. I paid for accommodation and didn't get it. And I'm not getting a refund.EDIT: 10/05/23 - I'm loving how Lastminute are trying to remove criticism of their shocking activities by claiming ""It didn't happen""... LOL. It did.

amy fyfe,"no booking, no solution, additional cost incurred of £1100","Arrived at our pre booked hotel: Best Western, The Boltons Hotel Kensington, London - to be told there was no booking in their system, they were full and couldn't accomodate us. Last minute's helpline not open at this time - to customers or hotel providers (11:45pm) at whicih point myself, my sister and my elderly mother were left out on the streets of london trying to find a room for the night. After phoning mulptiple hotels we eventually found one with availability at the cost of £700 for one night, double what I paid upfront to lastminute in August for my trip in December. I finally got through to last minute on Saturday morning and was told that would need to investigate and couldn't provide a hotel for that evening over the phone, I would need to wait. Already exhausted and stressed, I refused to wait for them as I had no faith in them providing an alternative prior to us having to check out of our emergency Friday eve hotel. I booked alternative accomodation, and was grateful I did as I didn;t get a response from lastminute with a different option until 11:54 am, being a hotel provider they would no common check out time is 11am. I am currently in the process of complaining and expect a full refund and reimbursement not only for the financial cost incurred but for the stress and upset caused. I have found the customer service department to be vague and unhelpful in their responses to my situation so far.  This trip was booked and pre paid as a birthday present for my elderly mother, who is now facing a credit card bill of upwards of £1100 due to last minutes complete incompetence and total disregard for their customers needs. I am so disappointed and disgusted at the way we have been treated by this company. I understand errors occur but to have no procedure for dealing with these errors 24 hours a day when offering a hotel provider servicer is unacceptable.

After 2 weeks of going back and forth, I was left to accept the change of hours which meant I lose 6 hours of my holiday experiance. Due to being a bday gift and all holidays booked from work, i was left to accept. Doing final checks before going to airport I have realised that I had lost my passport, so contacted lastminute.com and spoke to an associate named Megan (I know, that's the name associate gave). Megan told me to speak to airline company and the hotel and if they agree then we can change the holiday date. With both hotel and airline company accepting the changes, lastminute.com associate Lisiada then informs me that due to terms and conditions this is not possible. It seems that the company does not have a standard process. One associate says something different than other associate. After requesting Lisiada to speak to manager, she would not even connect me or take my request serious.

The prices were good but I went on the app as there was a code app 10 to put in for a discount of  10 pounds and this 28should have been taken off my booking. The site did not accept the code so I didn't get the 10 pounds taken off. I carried on to book the flights because the prices kept changing and I was concerned how much the prices were changing so I went ahead and booked. I contacted customer services but was told that once a flight was booked the voucher could not be taken off. This was disappointing as my husband and I are senior citizens otherwise I would have given more stars.,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,28 November 2022

Upon arriving home Iwas told by a chemist they were bed bugs bites. I contacted last minute, sent them photo proof of the marks from each day including 10 days later when one bite was still red and inflammed. 12 days later still some discolouration. Last minute told me they will do nothing as I didn’t complain when there and also I could have got them on a flight which is crazy considering I woke up with them. Very poor service customer.

It’s been 2 months and I have yet to receive any refund or even an update or an apology/compensation for the stress and upset I went through ! I am extremely disappointed in the service I received and lack of empathy / action.I have booked holidays with other sims third party providers such as tripp.com and Expedia , and when they have cancelled the flights or amended them on their part , they have promptly refunded me within 24-72 hours !!This is unacceptable from lastminute.com and, although I never leave a review , I felt this was important , to try and ensure that other customers don’t have to go through this unnecessary trouble !",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,05 September 2022

ALS,"Confirmed hotel booking did not exist! Be aware, SCAM.","Confirmed hotel booking did not exist at hotel! I booked a hotel in the Caribbean with Lastminute.com, a 3 bedroom villa, all inclusive. We had been there before so was really looking forward to it so as soon as I had the booking confirmation number I wrote to the hotel and said we'll be back and asked them about diving etc. They replied saying THEY HAD NO RESERVATION for us! They could not find any reservation, neither using the booking reference numbers, our surname or the arrival date. Nothing. I panicked, having spent almost £25,000 on this! It is impossible to get hold of anyone at Lastminute, any phone number you find online does not work. Their online chat is automated and does not go anywhere. So I decided to cancel it, which I could still do, and I got an email saying I would be reimbursed within 10 days. WE COULD HAVE TURNED UP AT THIS HOTEL, ON THIS TINY ISLAND, AND HAD NOWHERE TO STAY! How can Lastminute operate like this?!? I see online they are STILL selling this hotel and rooms/villas for the same period we were going to go. I talked to the hotel again who said that in fact they have a private function those dates so no rooms/villas should be sold for that period - and on top of that, they just don't offer all inclusive stays, something I had been sold & confirmed by Lastminute. This is totally outrageous. I wrote an email to Lastminute to give them a chance to explain, but no reply, so therefore anyone thinking of booking with them should be aware that what you are paying for through them, might not exist! Be aware. Check directly with your hotel/airline or whatever you have booked to make sure they have received Lastminute's reservation for you. Or better still, use a travel agent you can always talk to. I certainly will.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,22 November 2022

Talha Ahmed,One of the worst Scammers,"One of the worst, pathetic, rubbish l, disgusting and joke of a company to book your ticket with. In Feb 22 paid almost £500 and booked my ticket well in advanced from my travel date. My connecting flight was from Britain to Qatar and Qatar to Khi and back on one single booking. Within 10 days received a cancellation email stating that your flight to Qatar has been cancelled but no mentioning about my flight from Qatar I got really skeptical about it that why have you not cancelled my full ticket which is absolutely rubbish because if you have cancelled partial flight they expect us to buy full another one way ticket to catch your connecting flight which is equal price of full journey or maybe expect you to swim. Also they never gave any reason why British Airways flight was cancelled as the same tickets, on same flight, at same times and on same dates were still being sold but for higher price. Ok now I'll come to contacting customer service equal to none only via email or chat and their agents basically they are parrots or upgraded human bots typing same thing over and over again absolutely THIRD class service. Also they stated in the email from the time you have received your cancellation email it will take further two months for your refund to be processed which is understandable. Now here is another twist whenever I was able to contact the support they were two points I wanted to be crystal clear on before my departure date so they don't have any reason to deny my full refund to cancel my full ticket and grant me my full refund but the agents completely ignores what you are saying and will only mention one thing along these lines we have escalated your claim and put it on high priority which is absolutely a lie first couple of times I did believe as giving them benefit of doubt and second question was about eta of my refund and that also they took no responsibility and kept blaming the airlines and that they are only middle person and can't give any details until airline has approved my refund. now It's been Nine months of this chasing Nine month's at one point I thought maybe my next generation will be lucky to claim it finally I received an email today that my refund has been processed and they will give me or you three options to get your money back and I will list them below:1st: Travel Credit of £226 which is half what you paid, It really gets interesting here in that £226 you get £20 gift card for the inconvenience caused so its £206 actually and they will do me a huge favour of not charging me £35 Handling fees. Thats your first option, in my wildest dreams I wouldn't want to take that chance.2nd: Refund Voucher for £206 which to be honest I don't understand the difference between the first two besides in this one you don't get £20 gift card and still no handling fees.3rd: Airline refund of £171.95 so from £500 originaly what I paid to get my money back after NINE months and numerous frustrating emails and chats they will merely refund that amount and if you decide to choose this method Handling fees will be applied of £35 so I will be refunded £136 basically 10-12% of what you pay. My suggestion basically this is a scam don't use this company ever pay bit more money and save yourself the most miserable time of your life.

Now I have to wait 3-10 business days for the money to reach me so I can re-book a trip, but at obviously a higher price. Is this a scam? No help whatsoever was offered by lastminute or Rea the person I was chatting with.All they said is that this was the contract, and that I will have to wait for my money and yes the price would probably be higher.

Neil Dally,Misinformation,"We recently booked our flights for a family trip to Poland via lastminute.com. The original flights were Liverpool to Krakow; Krakow to Liverpool. A week or so after booking I was informed that the return flight had changed, instead of arriving back in Liverpool at around 12:30, we were now arriving back at around 00:15. Here's when it gets complicated. There are 24 going on this family trip and as I got an email to say my flight time had changed, the rest were told they were now flying back to Manchester (same time, flight number etc!). Due to this I contacted lastminute.com three times via their online chat to confirm my return flight, only to be told that I was in fact returning to Liverpool.A week before our departure, I still felt something was amiss so contacted them again only to be told this time that I was in fact returning to Manchester and there had been a mistake.

It is definitely a scam, they do false advertising, the customer service is the worst I have ever seem, and they deliberately try to rob your money. They committed a mistake, and because of their mistake I had to ask for a flight change. I contacted the airline and they said there was no cost for change, once the flights had the same fare. But lastminute charged me, apart from their €35 handling fee, an ""airline penalty"" of €178 and a ""price adjustment"" of €158, giving me a quotation of €369 to fix a mistake that THEY committed. It was already absurd enough, but it went worse, after I informed them that I contacted the airline and I KNEW that this ""airline penalty"" and the ""price adjustment"" were fake, they apologised and said they would send a new quotation. After a few hours, it came the new quotation charging EVEN MORE than the first, even after I said I had the confirmation by e-mail from the airline that they have no costs at all for changing the flight.

Adam,Wrong train tickets sold alongside hotel booking,"I have booked a trip to Bruges for Dec 2022. As part of the booking I took up the option of purchasing the eurostar tickets as part of the same booking with lastminute - classic upsell but convenient. We chose to do this because, at the time, the information on the website stated the tickets could be used for onward travel from Brussels to Bruges. This was in July 2022.I recently (Nov 2022) called up just to reconfirm that the eurostar tickets would indeed get us to Bruges as the information in the app suggested Brussels, only to be informed that actually they are for Brussels only. When I queried this I was essentially told - `well these are the tickets you purchased, it's your problem`. I also notice that now when booking a Bruges hotel on lastminute.com there is a prominent notification under the train ticket section stating tickets are to Brussels only. This was categorically not present in July. My complaint is thus:- Clearly lastminute have realised their error and corrected the site but anyone with an in flight booking has fallen through the gap and can't prove it (who takes a screen shot of that?)- Why oh why would you sell train tickets to Brussels only as part of booking a hotel in Bruges? Eurostar sell an `Any Belgium Station` ticket that is only £10 more than a Brussels only ticket. Sell that one!- Rather than have that ticket that would have cost £20 more for myself and my wife I will now need to purchase 2 return tickets from Bruges - Brussels when I arrive in Brussels at a cost of approximately £60. So I am out of pocket.- The attitude of the advisors when discussing this was that they could not be less interested. One even stated I should take it up with eurostar direct....I wish I had - they would have sold me the correct ticket. Another stated it's my fault for not taking up some form of internal transfer option - there is none!",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,22 November 2022

They call you but hang up after one ring,then an email to say they tried to call, u can not call the number back! . Now they want you to register another change. The cost to change was the same as fare. The cost f my bag was same as fare.but the promised 90% refund via voucher only applies to fare not bag. So i was offered 47£ refund no bag cost refund and after being run around for 5 days, i just rebooked my flight thru the airline and wont even use the voucher they sent. I can guranteed they will find a way to add some other cost to it. They shud just shove it where the sun dont shine. Worst experience ever.they count on gou to get frustrated and do just that.

In my opinion, a website’s success is based on customer satisfaction.

Vikram mishra,SCAM SCAM SCAM,"SCAM SCAM SCAM. Please don't use it as they have scammy site going on. Below are multiple reasons.1. No refunds, they don't refund your money. So good bye to your cash. If you opt for flexible also, they'd give you coupon which you cannot encash. This refund of coupons take 2 months. So you're left with no flights and some coupon you don't want to use2. Flexible flights are scam. On their booking page they say flexible means you can change dates without any extra fees, but when you do it once, they won't allow you again to change the same. So they hide away the details that you are only allowed one change, and you only get to know it once you've made the booking.3. Support Staff will lie on chat. Every one I talked to on support has lied to me in one way or another. some said you'll get refund in 2-4 days, when you apply for refund they'd say 2 months. 4. The site is unfinished. Cannot cancel the booking- throws error, cannot change dates - throws error. These are just 2 examples.MY advice would be to not fall for cheap prices when you are just going to lose all your money.

Eventually we were told there was no alternative and lastminute.com accepted them on our behalf. Our transfer times were changed accordingly for the outward bound flight but not the return.

Alan Riley,I am livid. AVOID. GO ELSEWHERE2168636361,"I am livid with this company. I strongly advise you DONT use them. AND I MEAN DONT. GO ANYWHERE ELSE BUT HERE.I arranged a ticket to Atlanya. The flight was late and I was notified.When it came to returning the flight was cancelled. No message. Nothing. Yet the flight company kindly reminded me to check in which I did.I arrived at the airport to find there was no flight.I had to pay nearly £800 on Easy Jet to get back to the UK. However, to Manchester when I was destined for Birmingham where my car was parked.I have just arrived home. I need to collect the car. I have paid £800, train fares and still have more to incur.I have written to last minute.com but I can tell you now EVERYTHING will be my fault even though I have evidence via screen shots that I was advised to check in as arranged.From a perfect trip to a total nightmare.If your going to put yourself in the same position good luck to you. Find a reputable service. I will naturally retract all of this if I get a refund but let's be honest these days the customer is always WRONG, its always our FAULT.This company is mopping up flights that are precarious. So precarious that they can be cancelled without you knowing.YOU earn your money. This company is quite prepared to take it from you.I just can't wait for the response. Do you think I will be reimbursed. Not one bit. ITS ALL MY FAULT. Its strange I get a message informing me of a delay. Im OK with that BUT a cancellation where you are still being asked to check in.

The airline informed me that there was no booking. Then the fun started. There is absolutely no way to contact customer services if you have an issue. There is a chat with a bot called 'Lisa' but this gets you absolutely nowhere. If you Google customer services you will find a number but it cuts you off. I emailed the various addresses I have but ultimately you get passed back to.......you guessed it, Lisa the unhelpful bot! 3 days before the flight I received an email from Lastminute.com saying that my flight could not be processed and was therefore cancelled. I had previously called my credit card company who informed me that the payment was authorised, so there were no issues at my end.

Lisa Mullins,RIPPED OFF WHEN FLIGHTS WERE CANCELLED,"My friend and I were really excited to book a Xmas markets break to Krakow recently and spent ages making sure we got a fab hotel in the centre and the best flights we could, booked airport parking too and we were all set....or, so we thought.... lastminute.com then told us the return flight time had changed, which was a pain, but not too bad. A week later it changed again to another airport in Krakow, again, that was ok. Then, a few days after that they changed the flight to A DAY LATER, which was no longer possible for us as we both had to be at work that day, and would have had to book an extra night’s accommodation (not in our budget). We requested a FULL REFUND but were denied this despite our protests, they kept around £100 of our money, arguing that they had provided ‘AN ALTERNATIVE FLIGHT OPTION’ via their ‘TRAVEL PACK’ small print. We were also out of pocket for the pre-booked AIRPORT PARKING too, as part of that was only refunded via a voucher, which will not be used now...another £20 lost!! We were completely disgusted by this appalling customer service...there was no understanding of their wrongdoing, and lack of responsibility for their messing up of our trip....why should we be out of pocket for Wizz Air’s clear over-booking of flights policy? To add insult to injury, while we were fighting to get our full refund, the website was STILL ADVERTISING THE SAME DEAL, with the same clearly over-booked flights, which were obviously not actually available any more. We deliberately used a PACKAGE DEAL as we felt better protected from this sort of treatment but sadly this wasn’t the case.

PT,"An awful experience, I will never use them again","An awful experience, Absolutely no help whatsoever when a flight was cancelled by the Airline. Three months of lies and deceit before I got (most of) my money back. Had it not been for Air Malta I suspect I would still be waiting.Here’s the whole sorry tale if you have the patience:On the 8th of May 2022 I booked return flights from Aberdeen to Malta for myself and my wife. The outbound flights (Aberdeen > Amsterdam > Malta) were scheduled for the 5th of August and the return fights (Malta > London > Aberdeen) for the 12th August. All flights were on one single booking. Total Cost £95016th July: Lastminute sent me an email stating that ALL flights had been cancelled and the only alternative was a refund, and that they would work with the Service Providers(s) to process. I contacted Lastminute via online chat and the Agent confirmed that all flights were cancelled and they were doing everything they could to process a refund for the whole booking (all flights)In the following three weeks:Lastminute sent me multiple emails stating that the outbound flights were still confirmed and that only the inbound flights were cancelled, repeatedly contradicting what they told me via telephone and online chat Lastminute told me multiple times via online chat and telephone calls that ALL flights were cancelled and they were “doing everything they could to process the refund”, contradicting their emails and what Air Malta told me.Air Malta advised me that only the fourth and final flight (London > Aberdeen) had been cancelled. The rest were all still active bookings and would remain so until Lastminute confirmed that the whole trip should now be cancelled. If this did not happen, and I didnt check in then I would be considered a “no-show” and no refunds would be possible. They had no refund requests from Lastminute and could only deal with the Agent, not directly with me.I repeatedly contacted Lastminute to tell them what Air Malta were telling me, and asked them to contact Air Malta and clarify the situation. The Agent repeatedly says that all flights were cancelled and promised that a member of the Refund team was working on a refund and would be in contact very very soon,. None of that ever happened.Air Malta / KLM send me multiple emails in preparation for my upcoming flights, and inviting me to check in onlineLess than 18 hours before we are scheduled to depart from Aberdeen on the 5th August I received a phone call from Claudia at Lastminute.com She tells me that our flights have been cancelled and they are working to process a refund. She also tells me it will take up to 2 months from today to process the refund. She can offer no explanation as to what has been happening since I was told all flights had been cancelled on the 16th July. I ask her if I will be charged an administration fee on the refund. She tells me that will not be the case as the cancellation was not my fault so there will be no administration fee. This turned out to be another in a long list of lies I was told.7th October. I have heard nothing from Lastminute, when I contact them they say they have had no reply from Air Malta regarding the refund, but they are continuing to do “Everything they can”. 9th October. I contact Air Malta who tell me they refunded the full price of the booking in cash quite some time ago. Their policy is to refund in cash within 7 days of a valid refund request. After some identity checks they are willing to contact Lastminute about the matter.Less than 24 hours after Air Malta said they would contact Lastminute, suddenly Lastminute send me an email offering me a refund! Of course despite the fact that Air Malta made a cash refund they try to get me to accept a Voucher, and tell me that there is no guarantee they can give me cash…but eventually they do give me a cash refund, less a £70 administration fee. When I tell them I was promised there would be no Administration fee I am told that it is clearly stated in the T&Cs that a fee will be charged.

The flight was cancelled by Ryanair the day before we were due to travel (due to Italian strikes) I paid for the holiday and flights to Ryanair and paid additional checked in baggage directly to Ryanair.Now the fun starts:1) Lastminute books flights with Ryanair with a random email and their credit card - first challenge.2) If you book the travel pack with Lastminute (they kinda force you to) then they will deduct the fee you paid for this from any refund even though I will never use the voucher they sent you as part of this package.3) Lastminute issued a refund via vouchers and require me to wait 6months to have a cash refund 4) Ryanair refunded the additional services I paid to Lastminute even though these were paid directly to Ryanair as Lastminute made the booking.5) If you open a dispute with your card company Lastminute say you have to close this before they will discuss it with you. 6) As I decided to go via small claims Lastminute refused to give me head office address.I would suggest a few things:1) DO NOT BOOK FLIGHTS AND HOLIDAY WITH LASTMINUTE2) DO NOT PAY ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO THE AIRLINE ESPECIALLY RYANAIR3) IF ALL ELSE FAILS SUBMIT SMALL CLAIMS TO THE 77 HADDON GARDENS ADDRESS THEY WINT DISPUTE IT,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,20 October 2022

I asked the lady I spoke to 7 times to speak to a manager for her to say back 'We cannot transfer the call to a manager' in which I repeated I am not asking you to transfer the call I am asking to speak to a manager. She then FINALLY said a manager will contact me within 24 hours after I persisted. £430 I have lost and this is how I have been treated. She did not even advise me to contact my bank which would have been a better option than to say 'we can't do anything at all'.

Everything went fine and I was more than happy… 2 hours later my holiday was cancelled due to price error.. I spoke to another agent this time on live chat to see what had happened and I was told to look the next day and rebook. I looked the next day and rebooked for different dates and flights to Turkey . 2 hours later I received a call stating the holiday was cancelled again, but not to worry as they could re book . In this time two payments for deposits have been taken (hopefully they will show as refunds in the coming days)… The agent stated this kind of thing happens and that it’s not last minute but flight providers etc…. I completely disagree, how can they sell holidays at advertised prices , take deposits to then cancel hours later. I get things happen but two cancellations on two separate days on for separate holidays makes me think this thing happens a lot with this company. I argue if these are even reputable . I won’t be using them again as the service received after the cancellations were the worse service Iv ever had.

Booked a flight for a return home and decided we might want to stay longer, so in the app, used the request to cancel function to see if we would get any sort of refund if we cancelled. Turned out we wouldn’t so we said we wanted to keep the flight and they told us too late, already cancelled. Basically if you “request” to cancel you’re actually cancelling. Why they call it request to cancel instead of just cancel I don’t know. There’s no confirmation, no are you sure, nothing. We have two remaining bookings with them and mysteriously, if you try that function it pops up that you have to call customer service, so I can’t be the only one who has been misled. Customer service has been shocking. I contacted KLM who are our flight carrier only to discover they have sent the refund back but lastminute told us there was no refund. I have tried to get them to tell me how much was refunded back and they won’t, and on an online chat they cut me off. Asked for a transcript of the chat and I never got it.

We got to the morning of our flight and nothing had been changed. After contacting them yet again we were told it is being processed, though with 2 hours to our flight that didn't seem like it would happen.If it wasn't for the helpful staff of the airline who changed the details in a matter of minutes we wouldn't have been going on the trip.The level of service from lastminute is awful and i wouldn't recommend anyone uses these to book any form of travel or accommodation!",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,28 October 2022

Lisa,Mixed bag,"Pros: great to be able to find a genuinely last minute city break relatively easily. Normally I book hotel and flight separately but the flight especially was proving very tricky as it was half term and everything was booked solid. Hotel was very nice.Cons: online check in was a bit of a 'mare as I couldn't find a way of accessing the boarding passes as all the links/emails were sent to lastminute and not to me, so sorting that out at the airport was a real pain. Not the easiest website to navigate if you've got problems once you've actually booked; they could really do with real people on hand 24 hours to sort stuff out; the virtual assistant was beyond useless and I was told to call the helpline at 8am. Not much use when my flight was at 10 to!",Rated 3 out of 5 stars,22 October 2022

Michael T,Know Your Facts and Rights,"Booked a package in June for a 5 nights winter break in Milan. Great flight times from local airport, good overall travel time, despite having to go via Amsterdam, and good price. Then…7 weeks before we were due to travel, outbound flights changed massively and what was due to have been a 5hr 20min journey had extended to 11hr 30min, including 8 and a half hours in Amsterdam airport ! In addition, our departure had been brought forward 24 hours ! Was able to speak with LM Customer Services without too much difficulty, but, over the course of 5 separate phone calls over a week and a half period it was very apparent that there was no consistency in talking to different agents. This either has to be because they aren’t trained properly, or, because it’s a deliberate company ploy to cajole customers into accepting significant changes to their holiday rather than cancelling, even when those changes are totally unacceptable.Eventually, I asked for a refund and although it took a bit of haggling, to be fair, this was completed with all funds back in my account within 5 days.My advice to all those booking a package with LM, and where significant changes to flights and/or accommodation have been made, is to pursue their Customer Services vigorously but politely and do not accept their proposals to seek alternatives that don’t suit your requirements.A second star awarded purely due to the prompt refund procedure. Had my review been based purely on dealings with their Customer Services, it would only have been one star.",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,24 October 2022

F Lyons,I booked a 5 day break and wish I hadn't,"I booked a 5 day break, checking prices across a variety of websites. Initially with booking.com I noted the secure payment went via lastminute.com, so checked the lastminute.com website separately. Noting an afternoon flight rather than mid-day with booking.com for the return, I chose to use the lastminute website to book. Prices were fairly similar. I checked the departure flights from London Gatwick were at the same time and then purchased 2 tickets. The confirmation email suggested I booked a much later afternoon flight to leave the UK. I contacted last minute.com immediately, within seconds of the email, to no avail. Essentially, despite this break being August 2023, I am locked into paying for the entire thing, or paying for a change to the flights costing circa £160. I am well travelled, go away for work or leisure between 6 - 10 times per year. I have never found a company so reluctant to make changes, despite my never seeing the return flights which were booked for me. I feel tricked.  The customer service agent was polite but unable to do anything... 'you chose that flight', that would be a flight I did not even know existed. If I went to book the same break now, with the correct flights, the flights are coming up even cheaper, but of course to cancel the whole booking would cost the price of the flights plus a very high administration fee.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,27 October 2022

Who can afford to just give hotels £100 to do what they want with? The bathroom was filthy with 💩 marks in toilet and limescale all over the shower, grease was leaking out of the door closure and to top it all, the breakfast we both ordered as an extra was seriously lacking. I asked if they had bacon, the girl behind just said no and I was not given any additiinal help. There were a spoonful of beans left and about 5 sausages and it was clear no more would be made, this was at 10.20, 40 minutes before breakfast ended. We left without breakfast and went elsewhere on the way home. One of the worst 'luxury' (is laughable) hotels I have ever stayed at.

It is over complicated and I am sure could be made easier.We stayed at the Center Plaza hotel and they gave us a front line room with what they called a view. It looked out over a square and as we discovered on the first night there were two nightclubs opposite and although the music did not keep us awake, when people came out it was incredibly noisy and we did not sleep past 02:00.We were moved to what they assured us was a quiet room without the view, it was not as it had a bar/restaurant below and the music from here was so loud we could not have the window open and the hotel was way too warm.

Judith Brown,Mixed experiences.,We have two comments.  Firstly the silly security checks by Pegasus in the Istanbul airport.  People had all their baggage searched and were frisked UNTIL the flight was called and then everyone was allowed to walk through unhindered.  Particularly silly as the area cordoned off was part of the airport main lounge and easy to pass things through the single strand barrier.  There was no point whatsoever for this as it meant that elderly people and children lined up for an hour.  Secondly the transport to take us to the airport could not be contacted and we had to book further transport and pay again.  Other than that the hotel was friendly - if a bit noisy - and the room pleasant and hotel situated close to tourist destinations.,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,20 October 2022

They have lied to me and provided me with absolutely no assistance of guidance. I could not say 1 single good thing about their level of customer service. I would never use them again and would strongly implore all others to steer clear as the chances of actually getting your value for money is slim to none.

At 11 in the morning, we were already on the street without a place to sleep and we called EasyJet, we talked to a very polite guy who secured us a room in a 5-star hotel at their expense literally in 10 minutes.And after everything was arranged by EasyJet, the miserable clowns from Lastminute send me an email at 11:21 saying that they couldn't help me because in their system it said that EasyJet had already helped us.

Shaun,Complaint made on 30th September 2022 and still no reply- escalating,"Complaint made on 30th September 2022 and still no response (see email below):FAO the complaints managers at Lastminutecom/The Ship Inn,On Saturday 10th September 2022 I made a booking for one night’s accommodation at The Ship Inn at Wylam via LastMinute.com for that same evening (ID booking 2142985539). A few hours later this booking was cancelled by The Ship Inn and they are refusing to repay the £84.99 I paid at the time of booking. In the afternoon, as my partner and I were almost at Wylam, to enjoy our stay at The Ship Inn, having driven over 30 miles, I received a call from an unapologetic gentleman who informed me that there had been an error, and that there wasn’t a room available, as housekeeping hadn’t got the room ready. No alternative accommodation was offered, no compensation, and no offer to reimburse fuel costs. Though the gentleman said he would cancel the reservation and so refund the money I had paid via Lastminute.com at the time of booking. Of course. So we turned off at Corbridge and spent the afternoon ringing around to try and find alternative accommodation.I’m not sure what the error was, or who is responsible, nor frankly do I care- that is a matter between Lastminute.com and The Ship Inn. As such, I will not be drawn into any disputes between these two parties, writing any letters to, for or about them. With all due respect, I do not wish to communicate, or otherwise associate with either.As it stands, a manager at The Ship Inn said over the phone that the booking had now been cancelled at their end, so that Lastminute.com, who is holding my money, could return it, as appropriate. But Lastminute.com have since told me: “Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain permission from the hotel to issue a refund for this reservation and the hotel has indicated that they will be billing Expedia in full. They state that the booking was confirm and there was no issue in regards to this reservation.”As the booking was cancelled by the hotel before we even arrived, it would appear that someone here is telling barefaced lies in order to steal money. If this money is not returned in full, in a timely manner, I will be treating this unlawful incident as theft, and the issue will be escalated accordingly. This process will first involve alerting ATOL, trading standards and alerting the public via a multitude of online sites and media channels, and will progress from there, until the money is repaid. I urge you to return my money in line with the expectations of the law. If this issue is not resolved in a lawful and timely manner, and my money is indeed considered stolen, this matter will be escalated significantly.Please confer between yourselves and resolve this unlawful incident with immediate effect.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,03 September 2022

Terrible!!!,"There is a lot to say so I’m going to write in bullets:• I booked a flight via lastminute but had made a mistake with the airport and was desperate for a cancellation. The first online agent who I spoke to about this said that I could only find out about my refund options after I cancel. Therefore I wouldn’t have the option of accepting or rejecting the refund amount. All of those options are ONLY available after I officially cancel- by which point I could have lost out on hundreds. This is highly unethical. Throughout the entire conversation, the agent repeatedly suggested that I speak directly to the airline as there was very little they could do to help me.I then called the airline in a different country who actually couldn’t help me as I booked through lastminute- just as I thought.•I spoke to another lastminute online agent who still said they couldn’t give me any refund options and this would have to go via the airline.•I then tried call lastminute however the voice/recording was faulty. It says to ‘press 1’ for existing bookings however when you press ‘1’ it says that it deals with ‘new bookings only’- existing bookings go thorough the online chat.Just a complete mess- it’s clear that nobody wants to deal with customer support and would prefer to fob you off.This was my first experience with lastminute and a terrible one; they cannot provide a straightforward answer.

They say they're refunding my money, but I haven't seen it yet, and even still, if I wanted to cancel it would have cost the entire amount of my stay.They should resolve, but they are doing nothing.All the negative reviews are correct.

The chat is automated and doesnt include the option to talk about a booking not appearing. Thankfully, the hotel offered to call LM/Booking.com after 2 hours of my trying on the chat to make sense of what was going on.The phone team appeared to be trying their best, but just offered me the explanation that it was a 'Once in a lifetime glitch' (Has anyone else been told this?) Going round in circles for hours, they could not find a solution and would not book me a new room in the mean time, their advice was to book a room directly with the hotel and call exactly 24 hours later to claim a refund. I ended up paying over double what I booked with them, not getting into the room until after 10pm and genrally feeling quite crap at the end of the day and following.The only telephone number which LM.com advised me to call, requires a booking number and a pin - I did not have a pin on my email so calling to claim a refund seems impossible, the advisor telling me to call 24h hours later was aware of this, so it all seems pretty scammy at this point. The issue was not resolved and still is not a week later. I'm concerned about posts online stating it took someone 8 months to get a refund. It is not a time to be holding onto peoples money when they can't afford to lose it.I called the hotel today, where I paid to stay and they offered to email LM.com to state what had happened and that this should faciliate a direct refund to me and an email should appear inbox or the payment directly.

Neil,Cancelled flight booking 2 hours before flight departure,"I had a problem with Lastminute.com earlier in the year, when a server error resulted in an incorrect flight being book and not only losing the money for the flight but Lastminute attempted to sell me a new flight at a grossly inflated cost.  I went direct with the airline.This time, I needed to book an urgent flight for the next day on behalf of someone.  I selected the option to have assistance and the booking went through.  However, I then received a notification that the booking had not been confirmed yet and would be confirmed shortly. There are no options to ring Lastminute.com for an existing booking to gain support. When arriving at the airport, we were told by the airline that the booking hadn’t been processed, so being unable to contact Lastminute I bought a new ticket.  2 hours ahead of the flights scheduled departure (14 hours after the flight was booked), I received a call from Lastminute, stating that they’re unable to fulfil my booking, as assistance cannot be provided and they would process a refund.  To leave it 2 hours before the flight was due to leave, before telling me that the booking is being cancelled, is appalling, as is the lack of ability to contact  human being for support.As it stands, 7 days after the flight was booked, I’m still waiting for a refund.  In the vague hope that someone from Lastminute.com reads comments, I would suggest as a company you learn empathy.  Having no means of contacting yourselves for support for existing bookings (only new bookings) and informing me 2 hours ahead of the flights departure that the booking has been cancelled is unacceptable.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,08 October 2022
Jack,SHOCKING.....,"SHOCKING.....I think that is the best way to describe my experience to date with them. We had a flight cancelled by Easyjet (another terrible company) last minute while in Munich. As we were forced to book a new flight through another carrier, my wife made a booking with Lufthansa for a flight the next morning (booking made at 5.30pm for a flight at 7am). Now, given their name, you could expect that this kind of booking would really be in their wheelhouse... turns out not so much!The booking was made & they took our money (1400 euro) for the flights. However, I received an email stating that they had not confirmed the booking but they were ""working on it"". Cue the next 12 hours of frantically refreshing the status page in our customer portal and about 30 attempts to use the chat bot to let us communicate with an actual human to no avail. At 4am we had to leave the hotel to go to the airport, still no news from them. I ended up paying for another flight that left at 8am direct with the carrier. You'd think the woe's would end there... they messed up, couldn't make the booking and would refund our money straight away... no such luck!This was over 2 weeks ago and still no sign of our money. Contacted them yesterday and this time the bot did allow me to talk to someone. The first person sent a message to the effect of ""we're really busy, you'll get your money at some point"" then disconnected. I then spoke to another agent who told me (in a very rude manner) that the refund had been actioned and we'd get our money. I tried to push as to why I had been told something totally different 10 minutes before but no solid answer. I was told they had sent me an email to confirm the refund. As I didn't want to leave the chat and lose the connection, i couldn't check during the chat. Subsequently checked my emails and what a surprise, no email! I'm pretty certain we won't be seeing this money in the ""next 15 days"" once it ""clears"" the bank (which sounds like BS as i've never had a refund take that long to clear). Appears there is no way to contact someone that isn't in a call centre / outside of the chat bot to escalate. Unless I was getting offered something 50% off retail, there is no way I would ever consider using them again. And even then, i would do with a view that it might not happen.

Mr James Parker,Customer service and communication non existent,"I’m sorry, it’s taken me two years to write this review as I’ve been giving last minute every opportunity to come good. I booked a trip to Marbella with my wife  just prior to covid starting. We were told to travel by last minute and did so. We arrived at our hotel and BOOM lockdown commenced that day. I received a email from last minute to tell me the holiday was cancelled and our flights had been cancelled. We were stranded in Spain with no help and no flight as the easy jet tickets had been cancelled but because the holiday was booked through lm.com it was up to them to rebook. Long story short we had to make our way to Gibraltar and book hotel and flight home ourselves. Lm. Com would not cash refund however gave us refund in a voucher with £50 extra, We argued that we wanted cash but got no where. We then booked another trip using part of the voucher leaving £70 left.  Covid spiked again and lm.com cancelled the holiday and gave another voucher(different one) A year passed and they got in touch to tell me I was due a refund of the £70 I hadn’t spent.

Then when you hit confirm the cost goes up by £100. I'm fully aware that many flight booking websites have you unticking add ons and this one was no different.

 Barrie Taylor,Pathetic customer service. Never again,"Having booked a return flight to Seville, I attempted to add a bag to my return flight. After 8 days, this email sent to LastMinute explains the insane service I received : ""Please, please, please can you finally help me resolve the insane process with a simple baggage booking, which after 8 days and endless wasted hours, is back to where I started and no one seems to be able to help. I am truly at my wits end with the ineptitude of your service.All I want to do is add my baggage to a return flight from Seville. It was simple to add the bag to the outbound via my account but there was no option on screen to add the return. The site baggage option kept telling me that the booking was with two different airlines while the confirmation states that both outbound/inbound are with easy jet!Since then I have had at least 5 virtual conversations, the last of which requested the addition but nothing happened. Subsequently, I have had at least 15 email exchanges, again, the last of which quoted revised prices for outbound/inbound baggage additions, which I joyfully accepted. I was told that there may be a change to price via the airline, again which I accepted.Yesterday PM @ 5 PM I was called and asked if I wanted to accept the increase and after a rambling, sometime incoherent exchange where your operative kept ignoring what I was saying, I thought I had finally confirmed the booking and asked for a confirmation email and assurance that my on-line account would be amended accordingly. I was told this would be done immediately. 30 mins later I was called by a different person asking exactly the same questions and again appeared to be impervious to anything I said. Eventually I got him to understand that everything had been sorted but I was left confused and asked to speak with a team leader. I was told I would get a call within 30 mins and I am still waiting at 11 AM. Then to cap it all 30 mins after the second call I received another email saying that the request could not be processed and I would have to make another one. Back to where I was 8 days ago!!!

We asked if we could move as I suffer from mosquito bites and they said they would see what they could do - we were actually filling the gap at the top of the door with towels.We didn't unpack for 3 days because they said we could possibly move, we did on the third day to a room without a gap above the door and with a door that could shut, so it was definitely an improvement.The food was very samey each day and being coeliac, there was not a lot of choice of food.  Salad for me most days.  And for two weeks this was not sustainable so even though we were All Inclusive we dined out 4 times to try and vary it a bit.The staff on the bar were really friendly but they were working with end of season supplies so the only spirit options were Ouzo and Vodka (luckily we like both), there was one beer the other had finished and the white wine ran out during our visit.  The wine for us was not drinkable, they were boxes that literally tasted like vinegar and I couldn't have the beer because of my Coeliac.We made the most of our stay as we love Rhodes but I do have to say I was a little disappointed with the hotel but my main disappointment was definitely the food.",Rated 3 out of 5 stars,19 September 2022

Glyn Frost,Last Minute - Worst Tour Operator in My Experience,"Lastminute.com are the worst tour operator that I have ever experienced. After booking a holiday and paying a deposit in February 2022, it materialised that the accommodation was over double the distance from the designated airport, than stated on their web page. The drive time was different by up to 2.5hrs.I contacted them and told them that this was unacceptable and that we would have to review my holiday to match the criteria that I had paid a deposit for. I was willing for them to seek accommodation within the distance booked and to the same criteria/cost. Initially, they said that I would still have to accept the flights from the flight and accommodation package and I was liable for the flight costs no matter. A stressful situation started. They said I could either book alternative accommodation separately or via them. They were my options and only options. After battling for a noticeable period, they finally cancelled the holiday which took considerable effort and lots of emails and phone calls. It was extremely stressful and it left me angry with the way I had been treated. The staff at their call centre in Albania are a complete waste of time. They are not accommodating and they are obviously trained to deal with callers in a particular way. They refused to put me in contact with a Manager/Supervisor because they weren't resolving the situation. When I asked for a Manager, the answer I got was, 'I am equipped to deal with this matter and there is nobody else to deal with it'. After weeks of protracted correspondence, they finally cancelled. Battle 2 then commenced which is not concluded yet and we are in October 2022. The refund was offered on my account via their website page after formal cancellation. When I proceeded to get my refund on their website, the box to proceed in, says go to refund options. There are no options once you press this option, the page is only designed to give you a travel credit and overrides the option of a cash refund. This matter is still ongoing. At present, I have a travel credit which I have no intention of using. If I cash in the travel credit, I will lose £130 from my deposit. Why would I want to pay or risk booking another holiday with a company who have total disregard for their consumers and have a disgraceful customer care service and a corrupt website which doesn't do as it says. The travel authorities need to be watching this company because their activities are outside the boundaries of fair business and they are possibly breaking consumer laws. They seem very keen to tell you to refer to their terms and conditions when you make a complaint but they have total disregard for statutory law and consumer rights. Quite obviously a business with no intention of supporting their customers and placing you in stressful situations where you have difficulty cancelling a holiday which can cost a considerable amount of money. They are also and obviously unwilling to pay you back any money other than give you travel credits.Be warned, tread carefully before you decide to book a holiday with this company. If something happens to your trip which you are not anticipating, you are likely to experience difficulties. I have good friends who are experiencing the same issues as me and I suspect I’m one of many. They are dirty mark on the travel industry.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,08 February 2022

However the next day, still the poor individual was the only person checking guests in. As a Marriott member I was sad to see such poor service.

No mention of this amount alongside this service mentioned in her email and no sterling equivalent either.

There were NO individual prices alongside ANY service mentioned in the email, just an end Sub-total, the deposit amount they would take and the total to pay once the deposit was paid.Will we have a shuttle service and a hotel once we arrive at our destination?

I was fuming again as I thought they would make some effort but nothing, I’ve rang them several times since including today and you’ve guessed it 4 months down the line I’m still waiting.

Begun chargeback process via my bank,"Didn't notify me that my flight to Bangkok had been rescheduled to 2 and a half hours earlier, so when I arrived to the airport I had already basically missed my flight. They notified my about a change of time to my return flight but not my outgoing. So I assumed that they were on top of it.I have been back and forth with customer services for months. They ignore my direct questions, reply with answers that don't make sense, tell me that I need to wait for the airline to release the refund for a cancelled flight (the flight was not cancelled).They refer to the flight as cancelled so that they can deflect the responsibility of the refund and reimbursement away from themselves and onto the airline. I find myself having to prove that the flight wasn't cancelled to every different customer service person I speak to.Customer service has been terrible and unhelpful.Forced to try and pursue other means of getting my money back from them.Anyone in a same position I have just started a chargeback process through my bank which I only learned about recently and I think is my only option at the moment.

Danielle Booysen,"Unethical company, needs to be shut down, part 1","I'll describe the recent events in 2022 leading to this review. I consented to recordings of all my phone calls between myself and lastminute, so they should have proof of everything mentioned here unless they deleted the recordings against my express wishes.On 10 August, I bought a return ticket from Heathrow to Durban for 13 - 28 September to visit my sick mother in South Africa.On 3 September, I phoned lastminute to request that my ticket be moved a week earlier, as my mother was in critical condition. They said that they would escalate the matter. I said that I didn't care about the cost to change my ticket, I just really needed to fly.On that same day, I received an email to confirm the change request, and I clicked the ""YES, I WISH TO PROCEED"" button and accepted the price.After midnight, my mother took a turn for the worst and she passed away.I once again contacted lastminute as my plea was a desperate one: I needed to fly as soon as possible to be with my family. I was devastated, but because I had already accepted the quote, and I was assured by a customer service agent that my case had been escalated, I believed that I would receive my new ticket soon.On 5 September (two days later and two days before I needed to fly) I received a missed call from one of the lastminute managers (from an unknown number) without any prompt that they would call. I looked up the number and realised it was in connection with lastminute, but I could not return the call as that number is dial-out only. I phoned lastminute's helpline again, and they told me to keep my phone on me at all times, as the manager will only call once more. Apparently the manager had to call due to a fee increase of something like £50 and needed to confirm that I still wanted to proceed. I said - once again - that the price didn't matter, I just wanted my ticket for the correct date. I mentioned again that my mum had just died, and this is probably the most important flight of my life. I kept my phone on loud, and when they phoned again, I answered. I could not hear anything on their side of the line; there were 29 seconds of silence and me saying ""hello? hello?"", after which they killed the call and sent me an email to revert my change request as they ""could not reach me"". No-one else has a problem reaching me on my phone.They then sent an email containing this:""We have tried calling you on the number you provided, however have not been able to get through.We have been unable to confirm the change you requested as the quoted price has changed.""You can imagine how I felt at this stage. I missed my mother's last moments on earth. I made it clear that I wanted to fly on the 7th. Lastminute confirmed my change request, and then retracted it.I then had to create a whole new change request to still change the flight to the 7th. On the 6th of September I received only one phone call from a so-called manager with the authority to action my request. But I did not receive it, as it shows that the call was ""cancelled"". Not a single other call on my phone has ever been cancelled - I make and receive calls all the time. This was either a technical issue from lastminute's side, or the manager did not really want to call me and ended the call before I could answer. They also did not give me a follow-up call, which is a strict company policy.A few hours later I booked a different ticket, just to make sure that I could fly to South Africa the next day. I did this through lastminute to prove that the dates that I requested were indeed available, and that there was no reason for lastminute to take so long to action my change request that I had made 3 days before.I then proceeded to ask that my initial ticket be delayed for a year so that I didn't have to deal with lastminute's antipathy while grieving the loss of my mother.I asked this via the online chat function (multiple chats), which I have copies of, and via phone calls.I gave some dates that would be welcome for me to travel to SA again next year (5 - 23 September 2023, flexible), and the customer service agent, Adana, logged the request.After midday I received 2 contradicting emails:the first one said that lastminute tried to call me re. the change request (this is the single call cancelled by the manager), and the second email said ""In accordance with the Terms and Conditions of the airline for the fare you purchased, changes are not permitted. Therefore, your booking remains unchanged.""This is for this exact same booking ID, for which a few days earlier lastminute sent me an email to confirm the change request and the cost of it.For context: my husband bought the exact same package, and his flight was changed. Someone at lastminute was obviously lying to me, as at least 3 different agents told me that I could change my flight.Review continued in part 2.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,06 September 2022

Albert OC,"Terrible customer service, SCAM!…","I put one star because it doesn't give the option to select none. Here's my story. Did a booking with them and after 5 days it was still pending, because the travel date was getting closer and closer I tried to contact them by phone at least 30 times and couple more through the live chat and it was IMPOSSIBLE to speak to anyone. After all, all I wanted to do is know the status of my booking. Anyway I tried again the day after and I suppose the voice mail recognized that the number I was calling from it was the number on the booking and stated the ""my reimbursement"" was being processed (never asked for it) and I even got an sms confirming so. At this point I assumed the booking did not go through and I did what I assume anyone would do, book somewhere else before they run out of tickets. At this point I thought everything was fine, but no! the day after reeboking my ticket I receive an email from lastminute saying my booking has been confirmed! Now I have 2 bookings when they clearly stated they were going to reimburse me. Somehow managed to speak to customer service (I even sent a screenshot of the sms where they confirmed the reimbursement) but is like talking to a wall, they keep repeating over and over that the fare is not cancelable, but obviously I care little about that, You can't tell someone you are reimbursing the tickets and then actually charge the customer for them. Probably the worst customer service I have experience in my whole life, the website is pretty much a scam and that they are allowed to operate under today's regulations tells you how little the gov and the big corporations care about the final costumer. I will sue them, I know it will cost me more than the ticket money, but is principle (something they clearly lack)",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,26 September 2022

Just lost over 2k because they REFUSED to contact BA to request a flight change even though BA had advised me that a change was still possible- lm.com simply referred me to their t&c - talk about unnecessary inflexibility. How can you request a date change and not get a call to discuss options in circumstances where the unavailability of the date requested would mean missing the trip and losing the entire cost of the trip. They are like robots. No brain.

Eventually, they said they couldn't find an alternative flight and went ahead and processed a refund for me, with a hidden £70 ""handling fee"". They offered their shady vouchers, which there is no way I would accept after this experience. It's baffling that businesses like this exist; everything about them is tacky, deceitful and fraudulent.

Ll,"SCAM, DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS AWFUL COMPANY!","This company is not at all providing the services and goods provided. Over a week ago our flights were cancelled.  8 days ago we was told within 7 days we would receive an alternate flight as our original for cancelled. We got offered a flight that wasn’t direct and was 12 hours of travel time in total. We obviously denied the awful alternative and requested another to be on the same day, direct and with similar timings to the original. This was 8DAYS ago!!! We fly in 4 days have had no communication in regards to this. I have had to contact the company several times. Send several emails and all I keep getting told is wait. And I must say I have dialled the customer service number over 80 times as they are not taking calls off existing customers. I’ve had to lie , say I was a new Customer just to speak to a human. If I wanted to cancel I would be able to but with a total of at least £500 fees. Even though in they’re terms and conditions it stated that “ 12.

Caroline,"They Lie,take money and don't honour your bookings","I booked flights with lastminute.com on Sunday 25 September.  I paid £7592.13.  They took the money from my account.  Yesterday (Monday) I got another email from them to say the flights could not be honoured and they would reimburse my  money in a few days!!  I decided to speak to them via their online chat as their phone number was for new bookings only.  The customer service agent (Naveen K) said that if I booked again on the phone they would definitely honour the new flights.  His exact words were (as I took a photo of the conversation)  "" Please make a new booking this time we will confirm"".  I said ""how do I know this"" and he said ""I assure you, this time we will confirm"". He gave me some telephone numbers to call, but i didn't have to call because LM called me straight away!! The agent assured me that the flights would go through this time if I rebooked at the increased price of £7,827.99 because he was speaking direct to the airline!!!!!  So I paid again for flights which LM customer service agent told me would be honoured.  Well surprisingly, today, LM have sent me an email to say the flights could not be honoured and they were issuing me with another refund which I would get in a few days,.  So I now still don't have any flights and LM have effectively stolen £15,420.12 albeit for a few days (well that's what they say anyway).  This is not my money.  I don't have this sort of money.

Carl,The worst experience that I have ever…,"The worst experience that I have ever endeavoured. I've worked in travel industry for 27 years. I booked a last minute package to Crete for me and my fiancée. 2 days before the booking I received an email to advise that the booking Could not be confirmed and that Last Minute.Com had cancelled the booking down and had sent a refund to me that could take between 2-3 days. This extremely upset me as I've never taken payment from a customer or Agent unless all elements of a booking were held and guaranteed and now that they had apparently made the refund instead of just holding it so that I could make another booking, we would have to find another £2.5k to make another booking. I decided to try and book it myself using different suppliers for the Hotels/Flights/Insurance and Transfers. I went onto 3 hotel websites and found the hotel at £1,100, more or less the same with all of them. I then went onto Lime Management and Skyscanner and BA.com and found the same flights but the airfare was £2,300 - £2,700 for both of us, more than the entire package that Lastminute.com had sold me. Got a call from someone in their accounts/finance department to say that the initial refund should take a couple of days and the reason the booking got cancelled was because the hotel was not available. That is very funny as I found it available on 3 different hotel websites. I know the issue was with the BA Flights and Lastminute.com system had made a huge error in the flight costs. I then went onto - On the beach.com and made a booking with them, hassle free with a better hotel and it came out to £1,9k. I will never be using Lastminute.com ever again and they used to be so repeatable only a few years ago, no wonder they are only 2 stars with trust pilot, shame on you guys.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,12 September 2022

Add to that the worst customer service I have ever experienced!We booked and paid £508.00 for flights with Last-minute, which were cancelled a few days later by the airline. The airline issued a full refund to Last-minute, but last minute deducted £105.00 (£35 per person/ticket).  What a fantastic business model: Take £508 from your customer, supply absolutely nothing, charge your customer £105.00 for the privilege of a refund. Money for old rope!  Memories of 'Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels' money making scams come to mind, minus the comedy!The publicly 'published' Terms & Conditions clearly state 'where the airline cancels your flight, you will receive a full refund, without charges'.  However, according to 'customer services'  the published websites Terms & Conditions are from 2015. The current terms are available after you've booked, within your confirmation email. Surely this can't be legal? Two sets of Terms & Conditions?The emailed version states 'if a supplier cancels, you will receive the refund the supplier offers, minus an admin /service fee of £35.00. It's also not made clear that this is per ticket. I could, under some circumstances, accept an admin charge, but to charge three times for something we did not do is, in my opinion, nothing short of theft!  We spent several hours going round and round in circles being repeatedly referred to Terms & Conditions supplied after the flights were purchased, while we were referencing the Live Websites Terms & Conditions. The customer service agents were belligerent at best. We were referred to their offer a voucher, equal to the value we had paid, to use with Last-minute within 12 months. Why would I EVER use their service again?So we are £105.00 out of pocket because someone else cancelled their end of the bargain! It's also worth noting that tickets of any kind (travel, concerts, events etc.)  purchased through a ticketing agent, are not covered by section 27 of the consumer credit act, so no recourse or buyer protection there either.Absolutely disgusting way to treat customers!",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,26 September 2022

Karen smith ,Disaster mini break which was cancelled on the day of travel,"We booked a 3 night break to Dublin with another couple back in May , due to travel this month. It included a flight and a 3 night stay. It was to celebrate a big birthday. We were also meeting another couple there. When we went to check in online on Friday, we found our flight had been cancelled. We immediately rang LM.com asking why they hadn’t been in contact , as we were advised by Eastern Airines was cancelled on 8/9/22 and they told us they advised LM.com at the time.We were then offered another flight at a later time at a different airport. We accepted this immediately and were told we would receive a confirmation email shortly with all the flight references etc. No email was received. We urged this over and over again for hours ( numerous calls and chats on their chat line ) . We also all endlessly checked our email and it was very stressful knowing nobody was going to help us. Finally, yesterday morning just a couple of hours before the flight was due, last minute chat line advised us to go to the airport without a flight ref- which we did but we didn’t hold out much hope. When we arrived it was as we had expected, we weren’t booked on the flight and there just 3 seats left. If we had booked ourselves independently the night before there were 5 free seats and the price was reasonable. The airline offered us the 3 flights at hugely inflated prices £700 plus extras - plus one of us would have to stay behind. We decided to try to contact LM.com from the airport. As soon as we rang it recognised our number and a recorded message informed us we would be getting an email confirming our flight ref asap. In the meantime I checked my emails and there was one from LM.com at 2.40pm (the flight was 3.05pm) it informed us that our whole weekend break had been cancelled by LM.com including the return flight and the hotel. We are back home now feeling very angry. We had booked museums and excursions and out friends waiting for us are on their own. We all had to make arrangements , take time off work and dog sitters etc. it’s been really, really disappointing.UPDATE It’s been over a month since LM cancelled our holiday at the airport . I’ve been on chat lines and telephoned Last Minute over and over again but still haven’t received a full refund. They keep saying I need to be patient. I was sent £315 to cover the cancelled flights but that they are working on the refund with the providers ?!? I’m guessing that’s the hotel . Until LM.com get the hotel to pay them back I won’t get a full refund . So not only did we have the disappointment of a 3 day break cancelled on the day of travel , but they will not refund the holiday and the expenses . I just don’t know what to do and have emailed ABTA and filed a case . I paid by credit card so I guess I could contact them .",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,24 September 2022

Dom,Scammers,"Booked a group of us on flights to Copenhagen based on the cheapest price found from skyscanner which happened to be with Lastminute. Once we got to the end and paid, the price went up by £80. I paid, as i didn't realise and then when i got the receipt i noticed the total price paid didn't add up to the price of total of the tickets combined. I kept going through it trying to figure out how this additional charge made it onto the cost, but it didn't make sense. I contacted Lastminute numerous times to try and resolve it and they were incapable of sending me a broken down invoice of the flight. They kept telling me there was nothing wrong when it was clear i had been overcharged. I tried to make an official complaint but the website doesn't seem to work for that either. I tried multiple computers with different search engines, but the complaints page just refreshes when you want to finalise the complaint. Pointless. I then noticed they had some of the names wrong on the bookings and had also put my friends baby/infant on the lap of another passenger in our booking. I mistake i definitely wouldn't have made. When i tried to rectify this with the airline, lastminute had blocked the tickets so i had to go through them for the names to be rectified and changed. This of course would have come at a charge. They couldn't do it on the spot for me and we had to wait with the hope that they would manage to change it in time for when we left. I tried to sort this out 4 days before the booking and just waited...waited...and they never changed the names. We had to do it ourselves at the airport at checkin. Also, don't get additional baggage through them when booking. They Charged £80 for return hold luggage and the airline charged £30 for the same thing. Absolute scammers.

Sam,Scam artists,"Genuine thieves, piggybacking other sites to trick vulnerable/elderly customers into purchasing through them. Then ""customer servants"" offer absolutely no help to rectify the situation, despite immediate contact being made. They are paid to defer customers just long enough so that flights cannot be changed. They use unethical distraction tactics, providing false email addresses, directing people to a portion of a site that does not exist etc etc. A truly shameful practice. Latest insult,when you pay to be checked in by the company, they cite ""technical problems"" and just refuse to do so, I suppose they don't care at this stage as they have already secured/stolen the customers money. The fact that they continue to operate in this questionable manner despite the horrendous reviews speaks volumes.

I told them I was not prepared to do this as our flight would now take 6 hours instead of 1 hour and this is not what I booked and paid for.

Philippa,Check in online whilst at home with good WiFi and,"We had a fabulous midweek short trip in Barcelona, I booked flights through Last Minute as it was easy to use and good to see all the different flight options.The problem was, our flight out from Birmingham was with, I thought, BA British Airways. When I booked it, online through Last Minute, all the confirmations, all the app confirmation, any email etc - all said BA.  Got to the airport, it was Veuling. I don’t mind whether it’s BA or Veuling, but it was very confusing that I was searching the airport for BA flights and it wasn’t BA!! We then had to do all the logging on through the Last Minute App and with the WiFi being down at the airport it was stressful.On the way back I’d chosen to fly RyanAir as the flights were at the time we needed. To check in online I needed a corresponding password for the Ryan air app from Last Minute. (Last Minute app creates you a pretend email to log on with and a pin. No password). So I couldn’t log into the Ryanair website to check in (as I’d booked through Last Minute and the log ins weren’t working). Made me wish I’d just booked the flights direct with the airlines as at least then I’d have my own log ins and passwords, not ones created for me. We spent so long trying to log in to check in online that in the end we couldn’t get seats together on the way home as the flight was so busy.",Rated 3 out of 5 stars,14 September 2022

Checked their website’s flight tracker and the flights were NOT cancelled. Used Section 75 to get the money back from the bank. Essentially, Lastminute cancelled the holiday and blamed the airline. The airline had nothing to do with it. Lastminute kept the money for the holiday and could never provide a date for the refund.  They refused to provide any proof they had been actively working to get the money back despite strong evidence to the contrary.  Difficult to get an airline to refund cancelled flights when the flights went ahead.Lastminute are completely unaccountable, anti-customer and probably need investigating by a regulator and/or a suitable law enforcement agency.

Then told I must be in Schipol three to four hours prior to delarture due to staffing and having to go through security and customs again once I land on a flight that left the UK around twenty minutes late.

Having missed already a day of our holiday the 17.50 flight did not take off until 19.50.The way home via Wizzair was no better really with our 21.20 flight not taking off until 12 midnight.I dont think my experience was any worse from other passengers this summer, the joys of flying from the UK.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,05 September 2022

They outsource services related to your trip to other providers so you are contacted by unknown companies who may possibly have access to your banking and personal details etc. without your consent. The ‘customer services helpdesk’ is very unhelpful and the ‘online assistance’ option consists of inactive links – e.g. the ‘enter’ button to request assistance/changes/advice does not work. The link to the ‘terms & conditions’ exists but has not been activated therefore is inaccessible. They book airline tickets without giving you the option to include a suitcase – when you realise this they offer you the option to add a suitcase for €230 each way !! – they make errors in the names on the bookings and then say they cannot correct the errors therefore your tickets are lost without any chance of reimbursement – they claim that this is in the ‘terms & conditions’ of the airline but you do not receive access to this information in advance of confirming your booking.  Any way of shifting the blame to others without accepting responsibility is good for “Lastminute.com” When 4 hours before the flight departure they still could not issue the boarding cards they immediately refunded me the €9 I paid for 'noproblem online check-in' leaving us in a terribly stressful situation while washing their hands of the problem - Save yourself unnecessary worry and financial loss by avoiding these crooks !",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,08 September 2022

We stated numerous times that if it was not possible to change, we would like to proceed with the holiday. The operator said she would see what she could do. 2 hours later, we receive an email stating that our holiday had been cancelled as per “our request” and no refund would be available. 9 months later, after 3 letters, numbers phone calls, we have received a pathetic refund for £77.11, no information about what this actually covers and considering the original holiday cost upwards of £500, it is quite frankly pathetic.

My passport was stolen, so I could not board my flight - once I could access my emails I contacted last minute 8pm on the day I was due to fly and they have refused to cover the 90 percent as apparently you cannot claim against this product if you submit the claim after the flight departs! So essentially you have to contact them while your plane is still on the runway or your screwed! So they’ve made 40 pounds on top. Absolutely disgusting AVOID. Don’t give companies like this business, book your flights direct with the companies so these places can quite deservedly go out of business.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,10 September 2022

Amis Sahni,Be warned of connecting flights,"We recently purchased a ticket with a connecting flight. The ticket was considerably cheaper than the same flight directly from the operator, so we decided to opt for the inconvenience of having to change flights. The time between connecting flights was just over an hour and we thought that would be OK, but what we were not made aware of was that we had paid for two separate tickets, and that with the gates closing 1 hour before a flight departure, there was no way we would be able to board the second plane. The reason: because each flight was booked with a separate ticket, we would have to collect the baggage from one flight and go through security and checkin all over again for the second flight. We thought the baggage would automatically be transferred to the second flight and all we would have to do is make our way the the other gate.Lastminute should not even be selling tickets where there is absolutely no way that a passenger is going to make the connecting flight.We only discovered this by accident when my wife called the airline for a completely unrelated enquiry. Nowhere did Lastminute make any of this clear on the webpage. This is the first and LAST time we will be using Lastminute. My advise to anyone using this site is to make sure that if you have a connecting flight, is the ticket you have purchased a single ticket? If it is not you have to collect your baggage and go through checkin again.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,03 September 2022

SD,"Flight times completely wrong, customer service not responsive","Me and a friend both booked flights through lastminute.com, separately. We thought we booked the same flight (evening hours), because the flight number matched, but found the flight times differed slightly. We then looked up the flight on the airline's website directly, where it said completely different flight times (early morning). Their customer service was unreachable by phone, so we tried the chat. The first go-around, it does not even give you the option ""Other"", so you have to do the whole automated chatbot experience twice. They tell you they try to get back to you asap, but refuse to give any kind of term. Two weeks later, I get back in touch because I've not heard anything, and they lie. They tell me that the airline changed the flight schedule, and to my friend in a separate chat, that there's an error in lastminute.com's booking system. They send me the ""new"" flight times, of which I had informed them two weeks earlier. So basically repeating my problem back to me. Even had the airline been the one to change the flights, they neglected to inform me. Only then do they ask me if I would like a refund, or alternatives. I asked for them to search for alternative flights, and they would try to take max 7 days again to get back to me. It's less than a month away. After some consideration, I try to ask for a full refund through chat, and they say as there is already a request in queue for the flight change, I have to email them. And through email, I get the fun automated response ""We're working on your request and will get back to you with a response as soon as we can. We'll prioritise your booking if you're due to leave in the next few days."" So I can't even book alternative flights myself while ensured I get a full refund back.Fun extra: they tell me I can track my requests through the online environment, and give me detailed instructions of where I'm supposed to find this ""My requests"" section. It doesn't exist. They ask me to mail customer care yet again with screenshots.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,10 September 2022
Dr Williams,Most frustrating refund experience I’ve ever had,"Booked a package deal to Geneva in October, with the website clearly stating that we could cancel the hotel up to 24h before our departure date. We sadly received news of a family member’s ill health, so decided to cancel with over 30 days to go to our holiday. Called customer service to ask how much we would receive as a refund, as we were not given a breakdown of the total package price, so we were unsure of how much the hotel, flights and transfers were all individually priced. I was told that my time for cancellation had “expired”, and that I was entitled to zero refund. I asked the call operator to kindly check again, as it clearly still stated on the live site that we could cancel up to 24h before. He kept talking over me, saying that our time for cancellation had expired, and that we would forfeit 100% (over £3000). I contacted the customer care team via email with a screenshot, of the still active offer on their website. Reply back said that the “proof” that I had sent “was not valid as it did not display the hotel name”! I replied to say that this was clearly from their own website, and replied with a link to the exact page, plus an extended screenshot illustrating the hotel name. Was then passed to the Escalation Team, who replied saying that there had been a “bug”, and that we were indeed entitled to a refund.I replied asking how much. Reply came to say that flights would not be included. I replied to say that I accept this, but how much would our refund be? Reply came to say that I would need to speak to Customer Care. Phone call to Customer Care, who, once again, said that I was not entitled to a refund. I explained re the Escalation Team. They said that they would need to speak to them directly. I was placed on hold. They came back to me to say that I was entitled to a refund. I asked how much. They said that they couldn’t tell me this, as it “can only be calculated by the Finance Team once the cancellation has been requested”. I said that this was ridiculous, as we wouldn’t know how much we would lose until it had been cancelled. I was advised that this “is always how it works”, and that “anyone else in the department will tell you the same”. Exhausted, I requested the refund. Email came to offer me 3 options: 1. Our holiday price in full, plus an additional £315 if we choose to take Travel Credit towards another holiday. 2. Our holiday price in full if we choose a Travel Voucher, which can be passed to someone else. 3. Our holiday money, minus flights, plus an “administration fee” of £69.99 if we choose to have a refund. I requested the latter and will never, ever book with them again.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,10 September 2022

Edward Broderick,Shocking customer service!!,I booked a trip to Venice recently and the flights were booked with ease probably due to it being with a 3rd party website. However when I went to book the hotel the payment had an error and my money was taken but no hotel booking made.I got straight on the phone to last minute and they informed me there was nothing they could do and I would have to email customer care to sort the issue out. This left me with no choice but to try booking the hotel again as I was travelling in 2 days and this time the payment went through. I had used a £30 off voucher on the first booking leaving me paying an extra £30 on the second booking. I emailed customer care as suggested and they sent a generic response back saying they would prioritise bookings close to the time of travel. I eventually got a response while I was away and money refunded but it was really too little too late. I won’t be using last minute again for this reason and the fact that the customer service representative was so rude and unhelpful has put me off even more. I am now £30 out of pocket and the stress is caused so close to the booking was really not helpful. You should be called last minute for a reason but had I not acted In the way I did I would have been left without anywhere to stay.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,26 August 2022

However, as the date got closer I randomly decided to check with ryan air and couldn't see any evidence of an evening flight.

I rang lastminute several times to ask them to confirm what was going on, only to be told ""We have excalated your query higher up and someone will contact you back"".

This went on from June till August. Eventually I asked them to cancel my booking. Afterward, i received an credit note for £35.87 out of £498 that I paid stating that they only refunded the hotel cost (for 5people for 2 nights in a 4* hotel Hanoi as per the original booking) and not the flight despite the fact that the booking ID was for flights and hotels and this booking ID was what i asked to be cancelled.

Kazanian's Emporium,Still not refunded for a booking they say wasn't paid for but which I have proven was.,"Booked a weekend trip to Venice and contacted customer service a couple of days later as I had not received an email confirmation. lastminute.com claimed the booking didn't exist and that they never charged me for it. I have spent the last 10 days sending them online statements from my credit card clearly showing the payment to them. They still have not refunded me and just repeatedly say that there was never any booking and they never charged me. I'm also trying to reverse the payment directly with my CC company because lastminute.com's customer service is useless and just robotically repeats the same lines over and over. I used the company because my brother had good experiences with them in the past but it seems as though the minute there's any kind of problem the customer is left high and dry. A shameful way for a company to operate. Use at your own risk.Updated: My CC refunded and then LM suddenly and miraculously discovered my booking (2 weeks after the holiday was supposed to happen). Apparently the email I gave them for the booking had an error in the address... therefore my CC was forced to re-pay LM 260€ of my money for a holiday they told me repeatedly didn't exist until after it had passed. At no time during my extensive requests for LM to help sort the mess out in over 10 weeks of contact with the customer service did ANYONE ask to verify an email or give even the slightest indication that this could be an issue, they simply repeated that the booking didn't exist. LM only put the effort in to solve this problem once they realised THEY would lose out on some euros. The CC refunded and within DAYS the problem had been identified, 2 weeks too late for me to take the holiday. The single worst experience I have EVER had in over 30 years of online purchasing and the worst customer service I have ever received anywhere both in person and online.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,05 September 2022

Stuart Starosta,WORST COMPANY EVER - Cancellation Fees are Extortionate!,"I should have known better, but I was lulled into complacency as I have used Booking.com many times and didn't realize that Lastminute.com was handling their package deals till I had already booked. Long story short, 4 days before our trip my wife came down with Covid, but they told me we cannot change our itinerary as the hotel does not allow any changes, so we cannot change the flights either. Since we could not travel, I elected to cancel the booking, thinking that we would face some penalties (buried deep in their terms in conditions of course). We paid about 1,600 EUR for our 1-week stay in Rome. And when we finally got our refund, it was for...wait for it...58 GBP. WE LOST OVER 95% OF OUR MONEY DUE TO CANCELLATION FEES, AND THEY CLAIMED THAT THESE WERE DUE TO THE AIRLINES AND HOTEL POLICIES, AND OUT OF THEIR HANDS. THEY ALSO TOLD US THEY DID NOT HAVE THE MONEY, IT WAS PAID TO THE AIRLINES/HOTELS, AND THE HOTEL HAS ALREADY DENOUNCED THAT AS A LIE.So we got completely screwed over, and while we could spend the next few weeks battling by phone and email, it is very clear they are used to complaints and will stonewall you over and over, so I don't think it's worth it.

Emma,DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!,"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!I booked a room at the Holiday Inn Express for 30 July 2022 via Lastminute.com. We checked in and we stayed the one night. The following morning I discussed my stay with the Reception who immediately advised they would refund the stay as my experience was not as expected and not to standard. The hotel refunded the ‘virtual card’ which sent the money to Lastminute.com and advised them to refund…Lastminute.com put up every obstacle they could to avoid the refund and once they had exhausted every obstacle, they started them all over again. We went round in circles for five weeks hearing their same excuses.They advised the hotel that the request needed to come from myself. So I obliged.LM then advised me that further information (invoice) needed to come from the hotel, which we supplied immediately.They then emailed to say:‘Just to let you know that we have confirmed your cancellation request with the provider(s). Unfortunately, there is no refund for the service(s) you have selected, as set out in the Terms and Conditions’.Each time I emailed, they rejected the refund stating they would not refund as I had cancelled at too short notice and directed me to their T&C which only informs of cancellations PRIOR to the stay. Each time the hotel emailed them (Cc me in) to advise that I didn’t cancel and instructed a refund because the stay was not fit for purpose - they said they wouldn’t speak to the hotel as their email did not match my personal booking email!I emailed Lastminute.com (and CC’d the hotel), confirming my personal information, giving the hotel written consent to also deal with any issues on my behalf - they gave us the same excuses again and again and again (Cancellation T&Cs and wouldn’t speak to the hotel).Having read their T&C thoroughly, they repeatedly state they are the third party and refer you back to the hotel for main instruction. However, they were ignoring the Hotel’s instructions to refund!?! So they can’t even follow their own terms and conditions ! I then decided to call (how stupid of me!) The call handler couldn’t resolve the issue, she just kept saying she’d raise a ticket, which is exactly the same thing as sending the email myself.They wouldn’t let me speak to a manager. The call handler advised me she didn’t know her managers name or who her manager even was!!!She confirmed she was working in an office building but refused to transfer me and refused to physically fetch somebody else or anybody higher than her to try and rectify the problem.We went round and round in circles with lastminute.com either deliberately blocking our requests or giving us responses that didn’t match our emails. The bottom line was that Lastminute.com were not entitled to keep the full amount of my money. They were just the third party middle man who took a small handling fee. It needed to go back to either myself or as a last resort, the hotel. I finally sought legal advice and sent an ultimatum email, highlighting their breach of the Consumer Rights Act 2005 and low and behold, I got my money back two days later…minus £30….so they have still kept their pathetic little fee!! I can’t even be bothered to quibble it, I just laughed at how pathetic and illegal this company is! For a company in breach of UK Laws and deliberately obstructing refunds, I will be advising all the relevant parties plus Watchdog, Which?, Trading Standards etc to make sure as many people are aware of these crooks as possible. Between Lastminute.com and the hotel, I had to send 40 emails in total AND begin legal action in order to have my money rightfully returned. The hotel were beyond amazing and I’d even said that if Lastminute.com weren’t going to give me my money back, I’d make sure it was returned to the hotel as I’d be damned if Lastminute.com were going to keep any money that didn’t belong to them!!

I was told to speak directly to the hotel, I shouldn’t have to, as I requested the hotel change in august, and my money was put in to the trip, I should be able to decide where I stay, not this joke of a company.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,02 September 2022

Syeda Begum,Fake advertisement of hotel. Don’t get fooled by what’s on the website.,Booked an all inclusive holiday to Antalya. My flight is on 3rd of Sep. I contacted the hotel yesterday to request twin bed only to find out the room they booked me is not in the Main Resort as advertised on their website. They booked me in a sister hotel 150 meters away where I need to get a bus to get to the dining facility and the main hotel. This is not mentioned anywhere on my booking. There is no easy way to get hold of customer service. I have chatted to 3 different advisor today and no one has been able to provide any information as to why they booked me a room in a different hotel! They sent me an email saying we got response from our agent that client had booked a room that is not in the main building!!! This is the query I raised as a complaint to them instead of investigating they just confirmed what I told them. I the ‘client’ did not book a room at a different hotel it was not advertised in the website. To make matters worse they said on for further information contact the number below. There was no contact information on the email and you cannot reply to the email. I fly out in two days and still trying to find out if they are going to give me a room in the hotel I booked. I feel like I’ve been scammed and robbed. I hope someone sorts this out by tomorrow or I will be raising this as a formal complaint. This is a complete mis advertisement to get customers money! I feel like my holiday has been ruined before it even started.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,31 August 2022

There was no cooling-off period or no agent to speak to but was just an automated message.I tried to content via chat and call but was directed to sell or told I do not have a booking since it's been cancelled.At this point, we are all aware of the current economical situation and where I am struggling to pay my basic bills this refund comes as a shock for me. I am still very curious about how transparent the charges are or any action that can be taken by your management team to avoid your customer having to suffer from this anxiety and helplessness.I look forward to hearing back from your management team. But my email was ignored too.

kamil majchrzak,Worst Customer Support EVER!!!,"DON'T BOOK WITH LASTMINUTE UNLESS ITS THE ONLY OPTION.They are very sneaky. Even if the website states that something is included in the ticket (For example hand luggage or other benefits), it is not ""confirmed"" as i was told by the customer support team and its not apparently their fault if their website falsely advertises anything.I bought a flight with them which on the website stated that the hand luggage was included. Only after i went to check in (directly on the airlines website), i found out that actually no hand luggage was included. I've reached out to Customer Support straight away, showed them the proof of the false advertisement, and they agreed initially with me that the mistake was on their side. I was instructed t purchase the hand luggage directly with the airline as they weren't able to add it, and later send them the receipts to get a refund for the value.That's where the fun started..... I've waited almost a year, with lots communications with them to get my money back. After multiple ""investigations"", they finally today said that i am not entitled to the refund stating that even if their website advertises something, it doesn't mean its true.... The worst is, if they could say that from the start, i would have cancelled the flight with them and got the full refund but of course 1 year later that is impossible.Never buying with them again, it might be cheaper than over websites, but i would rather pay a few more bucks and have a hassle free experience (if something happened), instead of dealing with LastMinute customer support ever again.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,31 August 2022

Wizzair then stated I needed to pay to select seats together or would be random allocated seats. I was expecting there to be a link between my booking with lastminute.com and Wizzzair so they knew I'd already chosen seats and paid for them.Wizzair was a stressful outgoing flight too due to the baggage check in opening 30 minutes late and then they did not prioritise the passengers who were on the due flight (one queue for different destinations). It wasn't until one passenger in the queue barged through to the front and told the staff we were going to miss the flight as we still had to get through security. The staff then in a fluster said we didn't need to show pass or anything and just rushed us through. We had to run for a final call even though we had been waiting hours in the airport.

Miss Teri Song,Wish I could give zero stars,"Wish I could give zero stars. Appalling company. Do not use them.  Should be called last minute.CON.  After accidentally cancelling a booking I immediately contacted last minute.com by chat and phone to ask them to reinstate the booking.  My Hotel were happy to reinstate the booking, but last minute.CON refused to assist me in any way.  They won’t reinstate the booking, they won’t refund my money, they are not going to pay the Hotel, they are just keeping the money.  The hotel have advised me to claim the money back via my Bank as they are acting fraudulently as it is not the terms they agreed with the platform.  I am going to attempt this.  Yesterday the con artists were blaming Expedia, and told me to contact them if I wanted my money back, but Expedia won’t help unless I make an expensive international phone call and start all over again.  I guess my money has gone. I’m out of Pocket several hundred pounds. They’re hiding behind their T&Cs but at the same time ignoring the T&Cs they agreed with the Hotel. I have written evidence that they have no intention of paying the hotel.  I fully expect In a few years time a no win no fee company will set up to claim money back on behalf of people like me who’ve been victims of their outrageous lack of morals and complete disdain for customer service. My advice. Do yourself a favour, do not trust this Company unless you can afford to lose ALL your money.  They are very welcome to contact me to prove to me they give a damn. I have reached out to them but so far they’ve ignored all my attempts to reach them.  If they do rectify the situation I will post an update.  I fully expect they won’t give a damn.  Having done some research on just how many people are furious with them, I’m amazed they have somehow managed to get any positive reviews.March 2023Update.  Last minute now want my details otherwise they’re going to take my review down.  I’m not giving them the satisfaction.

Sarah F,"Horrible service, not the brand it used to be","I booked with this travel agent based on its former reputation as a brand with good customer service. Unfortunately it has since been bought out by Bravofly, a Swiss company, and its standards have nosedived. My flights were cancelled and lastminute have made a long-drawn-out mess of organising a replacement flight. After confirming the wrong details, booking me a new flight I hadn't agreed to with a 27h layover, insisting I had no entitlement to a refund under EU/EU261 law, trying to fob me off on the airline, who then fobbed me off back onto them, and failing to have a supervisor call me back twice, they have driven me to palpitations. I have chased the issue multiple times over the last month and just now have been confronted with a robotically cheerful and empathy-free call centre agent who shouted me down when I attempted to explain the issues to date, which apparently were recorded wrongly on her case management system (if they use one - judging by the service it might well be a load of post-it notes) and behaved as if I was being totally unreasonable. I am beyond stressed about what should be an enjoyable anticipation of a major trip overseas, I have spoken more rudely than I ever wanted to to a robotic Swiss stranger because I lost my temper, and now feel like smashing something and/or crying.

Piotr,Hotel was fully booked out when we have arrived,After a problem with my previous reservation in Donegal I have decided to give lastminute.com another chance and book this weekend (one night - 27th -28th Aug) in Fethard on Sea.What a mistake that was!When we arrived at Baginbun Lodge in Fethard yesterday we were told by the owner that the hotel is fully booked out and she cancelled our reservation with the travel provider - you guess that right - LASTMINUTE -   as soon as she received one - which I booked on 22nd August.This is absolutely shocking level of incompetence as no one from lastminute.com bother to inform us that booking was cancelled. We were left stranded in Fethard without accommodation!I was trying to get an alternative accommodation on the spot in the area but all places were fully booked out for this weekend.  We had to turn back and return home yesterday! As you might imagine we are hugely disappointed as this was our wedding anniversary weekend.This is totally unacceptable. I have requested a call from manager ASAP.UPDATE 30/08: After speaking to Gerardo from escalation cs team I can confirm that this case was resolved to my satisfaction - cash refund for the full amount. Added one star to the review as I do recognize that Gerardo tried to help and he kept me updated through the process.,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,28 August 2022

We came to the car rental office and spent 1,5h to clarify the situation. The car rental told us, that our booking agency (lastminuteDOTcom) canceled our booking. Car rental offered us to book a car for a much higher price afterwards. We declined it and took taxi to our hotel. The car rental price which we got from the lastminuteDOTcom was surprisingly low, it was like 60% of what we found online on our selves. So I think, lastminuteDOTcom  just gave us some random good price to hook us with it. We could reach the customer service of lastminuteDOTcom some days later, they offered us a refund for the car which we got. But we didn't get any offer for a new car rental.

However the real issue was with the return. The airport was over 2 hours away and I checked with the hotel was told have to get 2 trains and a taxi to get to the airport. Or pay for a taxi which will cost €200.I then got on to lastminute.com to change the return flight from an airport that was easier to get too. On Sunday they said that it will cost €90 to get this changed,I had 48 hours to accept this. I accepted it straight away. I emailed them on Monday they said they will get back to me to confirm the change. On Tuesday I got a call from them the day before my flight home.They increased the cost of the change to €120. Even though on the Sunday when i requested the change it was only €90.

 Toni Meadows,Please do not book any extra services via lastminute.com as they are dishonest,"Please do not book any extra services via Lastminute.com or Booking.com for your holiday, as the extras they offer are designed to con you out of money by including undisclosed arrangement fees.The luggage booking inflates the cost of hold luggage with budget airlines to ridiculous levels. Go direct to the airline after booking and ignore the Lastminute.com or Booking.com attempts to get you to overpay.We avoided the above but were suckered into booking an airport transfer via an telephone agent. When I realised that, of the £150 cost, almost half (£70) was an arrangement fee going to Lastminute.com that was not declared in the booking process, I tried to cancel. As it has been only few days since the original booking and we were over one week away from our trip, I was told by a telephone agent that we could have a full refund.In the event we were offered a voucher on a future booking which again was minus a made up charge of around £40. If we didn't accept within a few days the offer was set to expire and we would be given £8.40, again due to made up charges.This sounds bad but the offer didn't even run to the date they said it would, Lastminute.com withdrew it early and defaulted to giving me £8.40 back, which they regard as a full refund on a payment of £150 that was full of undisclosed costs.I complained on numerous occasions before we flew but was fobbed off with a standard line of ""we are looking into it."" We returned from Holiday yesterday and still no response to our complaint.The procedure around booking extras on a trip is dishonest and the complaint handling process at Lastminute.com is non-existent. I can't even speak to them now because the website only recognises future bookings on their system.On our flights other people were complaining about Lastminute.com for the same reason so there must be a lot of people that have fallen foul of their sharp practices on trip extras.

She said that was nothing to do with them as they are a different department. I asked why they had not paid the airline for my return journey. She said again it was nothing to do with them as it was a different department. I then tried to get onto the website with my booking number and the website said this booking number does not exist.

Joseph,You will spend more money than expected,The package was good but less details from the hotel to customers. The operations from the hotel should be more detailed fir customers to choose not just a package from a random hotel. They take deposit of €350 from a credit card throughout your stay. This is a burden because you may not have prepared for that. The government taxes and city taxes should be highlighted so that customers are prepared for all these extra costs. As I said the package from lastminute.com was good but the other side was so bad that you will spend more money than expected. I wasn't happy for an unplanned budget.,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,21 August 2022

Jerome,Do not use this company EVER - book direct,"I am currently in the process of investigating whether this complaint can be escalated to an external authority such as ABTA or ATOL. My experience of lastminute.com is that they lie, they do not care about the anxiety that they cause their customers and they are only interested in making as much money from people as they can. I booked a flight from London Gatwick to Denpasar in Bali, via Bangkok and Singapore. This was flight booked months in advance for what I thought was a reasonable price. 4 weeks before I was due to fly I was contacted by lastminute.com to say that my flight had changed. Instead of leaving from Gatwick UK, I would have to leave from Bangkok! I phoned their customer helpline to explain that I lived in Southampton UK, and I needed a flight from the UK, not from Bangkok. I was told that they would have request a change to the flight so that I could have my original flight from Gatwick. I was told that they would contact me within a week. I waited a week, and true to their word they did contact me, with a new flight......a different timed flight....leaving from Bangkok!! I phoned them again! They said they would have request yet another change to the flight. I explained again, that I lived in the UK and as such I need to fly from the UK (which is why I booked my original flight from Gatwick)....I can't teleport myself to Bangkok! I was told that I'd have to wait another week for this to be sorted. I was very upset by now because I had less than 2 weeks to go until my flight to Denpasar and my anxiety was through the roof. I had onward travel and accommodation waiting for me and this was the first time that I had travelled since before lockdown. I waited a few more days...and guess what? The same thing happened! At this point I was beside myself with anxiety and I'm not ashamed to say that I cried....alot!I decided to do some investigating myself, I went on the airline's (Scoot) website to see if the original flight I booked was still operating. To my surprise, it was. The only difference was that the flight was now selling at 3 times the price that I paid a few months ago. I decided to phone Scoot airline direct. To my absolute shock and disgust, Scoot informed me that THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO ISSUE WITH ANY OF MY FLIGHTS AT ALL! I was booked on flights from Gatwick to Bangkok, Bangkok to Singapore and Singapore to Denpasar. The Scoot representative told me she had absolutely no idea why lastminute.com would be telling me that there were issues with my original booking. Seconds after contacting the airline direct, I received an email from lastminute.com to say that they would no longer be communicating with me because I had approached the airline directly. All I can assume is that lastminute.com were hoping that the pure anxiety they caused would have lead me to cancel my flight and rebook at price that was £1000 more than my original booking. I was very close to doing this, had I not had the foresight to contact the airline direct. My advice to anyone being messed about by lastminute.com is GO DIRECT TO THE AIRLINE IF YOU CAN BEFORE BELIEVING WHAT LASTMINUTE.COM SAY!If you haven't booked a holiday with lastminue.com yet, THEN DON'T!THEY DON'T CARE about the customer, they lie and will do little or nothing to help.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,20 August 2022

When I called I queried if it would be possible to get a refund as it was due to COVID-19 and there were UK government restrictions in place to which the agent said, as long as the hotel can confirm that they have cancelled the booking and confirm that lastminute can go ahead and process the refund, that should be fine. I did as I was instructed straightaway and got the hotel to send an email confirmation of the cancellation due to COVID and instructing lastminute to release my funds back to my account. I then called the agent back and they advised that this was okay and to wait a week for this to be processed.After waiting a week, I called back and was asked to wait longer and this continued every week until 1st October 2021 when I spoke to someone called Edison from lastminute.com who said that they have 'fast-tracked' the refund and that I should hear back within a week. After a week, surprise surprise, I did not hear back anything. Due to this I called up and asked to raise a complaint to which they said this can only be done by raising a ticket online, they don't have a complaints telephone line which baffles me. I then raised another ticket to which I've not heard anything back. A few months passed and I'd almost forgotten about it (which is what they probably want) but then I decided to follow-up on this via email. This time I received no response.It's now beginning August 2022 and I've chased this up again and I'm met with the 'high volume of queries' response. Since then I've not heard anything back regarding my refund and it's been over a year. I do not trust what lastminute.com say, they have terrible customer service and inaccessible routes of raising complaints let alone actually resolving them based on my experience with them. Waiting over a year for a refund should never happen. I would 100% avoid this company as they are definitely not there for you if anything goes wrong.Quick to take your money and do not follow through on their words if anything goes wrong. Please spend the extra money if needed to go to a company that actually cares about the customer.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,17 August 2022

Bhav,My experience with last minute was horrendous,"My experience with last minute was nothing besides frustrating. I found it to be an unjustifiable money-making scheme, combined with a lack of care for customers. We booked a flight through Skycanner recommending Last minute as a 5 star reviewed agent (far from the truth after Googling it). After our mode of transport fell through for the return flight (a week and a half before the actual flight time) I tried rebooking the flight through last minute. Firstly, getting a hold off them was difficult, I spoke to four agents who said that there wasn't any other times available on Sunday, the day we were due to return. Mind you, I notified them a week and a half in advance. I looked on their site, and pointed out that they had 10/11 options as return flights on that day. Four days passed by and they finally confirmed a return flight change, quoted at £220, of which almost 50% of the fee was for them handling the case. The process for accepting this was simple, they send an email and you click agree if you do. From this point on is where the process was horrendous, I called them up daily to process this flight change. All the agents reassured me not to worry and that their service team will call me up in the next 3/4 days to book the flight and take my payment. They called me up as the agent advised, and they changed the quote to over a £1000 for the flight change. I'll leave my review there, it's a terrible service, never will use these guys ever again.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,17 August 2022

LM,Worst customer experience of my life,"Was part of a group of friends that booked a trip to Las Vegas, went through lastminute as a supposedly reputable company while others went through other sites. Ticket involved connecting flights from Dublin to Heathrow, then Heathrow to Las Vegas. Return leg (LV to LHR) was moved back so final leg of journey (LHR to DUB) was now invalid (1st flight now scheduled to arrive after 2nd flight departed). Spent weeks trying to get lastminute to amend the LHR to DUB flight so the entire itinerary remained valid, was told numerous timelines - 7 days, then 36 hours, then 48 hours and then finally a continuous 24 hours. The whole time they were reassuring me it would be amended (approx 15 LHR-DUB flights run every day so should be easily amended). Friends who used other sites had these flights amended quickly and with no hassle.1 week before the trip I receive an email that instead of amending by flight, the entire itinerary has been cancelled - all 4 flights are now invalid and I will be refunded (£600 - this took around 2 months to be paid). This was NEVER suggested to me by any person I spoke to.So in order to go on the trip I had to rebook through a different site which cost £900 and I am out of pocket £300 as a result of lastminute's incompetence. By far the worst customer treatment I have ever experienced & will never use the company again. Would urge anybody to stay away from this company given the uncertainty with flights these days as one small flight change and you are at risk of being completely ripped off.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,16 August 2022

I was told by this agent that I would hear back from them within four days.Seven days later I had still not heard anything so I rang customer services. Sam at front of house said my request was still in the queue on hold but said he would escalate it for me so that it got looked at and this would usually be within a couple of days. I called again 3 days later because I had heard nothing via phone or email as was promised. I spoke to someone called Christian, he was polite enough but basically reeled off the same old line about he would escalate it to the ‘other department’. I requested to speak to a manager but was told that he couldn’t put me through to any other department or a manager and that my query was still in the queue and he would escalate it again. I said I was not happy with this and wanted to place a complaint, he said he could not take this complaint from me and I would have to do it on the website. What a load of rubbish!!!Awful customer service, feel like you’re constantly being fobbed off with no resolution. If I was able to make the amendment myself then I’d happily do it!

Last minute claim that it was cancelled because of a 'technical problem' and that it is out of their power to rebook my flight (which is odd, as that is what their business does), which was one of the solutions that I proposed. My bank confirmed that Last Minute are able to immediately refund the money, if they want to (ie the story last minute is telling is not true about it being an issue with the bank) and that there are many complaints with them of the same nature.

Olena J,Offered us to swim 54 miles,"While searching for a Greek holiday package on lastminute.com, I was offered a hotel and a flight included. After checking the distance between the hotel and the airport, I was advised that it was a 54 miles. That was fine, however, after booking and contacting the hotel I was informed that the airport was located in the different part of the country and furthermore it was on a very remote island. 54 miles was the distance by water which they, probably, assumed I would swim on my holiday suitcase. There was no ferry connection on that day between the islands where the hotel and the airport were located. Panic and helplessness overwhelmed me completely. How can this flight appear in the package at all??? After contacting the lastminute agents 3 times, I faced bored and blind indifference to the problem. Two of the three agents I spoke to indifferently listened, refused to connect me to the manager, one of them was yawning in the receiver and blamed me that it was my fault that I conscientiously picked that flight!! and showed no sympathy in trying to change the flight and the airport. As a result, my holiday was ruined from the very beginning as my journey to the hotel took me 24 hours when I had to travel 404 km from the airport using a ferry, taxis, buses and two trains in 36 C which added hundreds of pounds to the trip. To say that I was sorry I used lastminute is to say nothing. Never in my life I will advise lastminute to any of my friends.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,13 August 2022

Anto,Don't book a holiday with Lastminuite.com,"What ever you do do not book a holiday with Lastminuite.com because if anything goes wrong you won't get them to 1/ sort it out 2/ get you money back.So this is what happen to us.we booked a holiday with them for a week away in a 4 star hotel with flights and half board from Saturday 14th of May to Saturday 21st May 2022. A few weeks later I received an email from them saying that they have changed the flight, hotel and transfer date to Sunday 15th to Sunday 22nd May and that they would notify the taxi company and hotel of the change. That's were it all went wrong. as they did not do any of that.So we are at home in England on Saturday 14th May when we got a phone call from a taxi driver in Montenegro asking were we are! So we told him that the flight details had been changed to the next day, so we will be there tomorrow and that the travel company Lastminute.com should have informed you of the change, which they obviously had not, and can he pick us up tomorrow instead which he said he could not and that we would have to paid for a taxi when we arrived on the 15th. So I tried contacting Lastminuite.com to sort this out which they said they would do. but guess what they did not. I therefore emailed the hotel direct to let them know of the the change in dates. However when we did get to the hotel they said that Lastminute.com or there local agent had not been in touch so we would have to pay for an extra night. which we were not happy about. anyway we have the same problem with the taxi driver turning up on the Sat 21st, so after trying to contact Lastminuite.com while on holiday to no avail we decided to take the taxi to the capital which was near where the airport was and pay for a cheaper hotel there rather than pay for another taxi on the Sunday and the expensive hotel we were staying in.So when we go home I then had to spend many more hours trying to get a refund out of Lastminuite.com for there mistakes, which finally they agreed to back in June and I am still trying to get the money out of them to no avail. a nightmare company to deal with.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,11 August 2022

Some of their customer service reps are rude AND all of them I spoke to offer absolutely no value, one was very patronising and said to me ""so what, the computer magically chose to cancel all flights"" after I told them I didn't make the cancellation request. No sympathy at all, no consideration for the person or situation at all.Words honestly do not justify how useless they were, on top of that, their mistakes have cost me and they simply don't care.

Richard,This company is just so bad,"This company is just so bad.  I tried to book a holiday in Majorca for my family and me and had a query so I called them up.  There was then constant pressure over the phone to book a holiday and I fell into the trap of booking something.  They got all our names wrong for the flights despite me spelling out each name in using the phonetic alphabet.  Once I spotted this I tried to correct THEIR error only to be slapped with a £100 charge for changing the details?!  I wont go into other details about their total inflexibility, poor customer service and the 'computer says no' mentality of pretty much everyone who works there.

Check website which still shows the same holiday for sale that they say is unavailable. We asked for any alternatives as we were on the motorway bags packed ready to go. told that sales would call back.....nothing... what a shambles, I cant work out what scam they are running here, not sure if they have any allocations of seats on planes or hotel rooms, or if they just take loads of bookings and actually give the places to the highest bidders or something???

Doug,Pointless service.   Book direct instead.,"Seriously disappointed in the pretence that is lastminute.com.Theoretically booking a package (Flights, Hotel, Transfers) should be more convenient than doing it all yourself but it was anything but.Flights :- they booked Ryanair tickets for us and we paid for this ""special no hassle"" service for boarding passes.   In reality this means that a Lastminute staff member waits until the last possible minute to check using free Ryanair check in - therefore absolutely no chance of a group sitting together.   Verdict - would have been infinitely better just booking flights by ourselves.Hotel :- in common with other comment's I've seen our lastminute.com booking resulted in possibly THE WORST POSSIBLE room in the hotel.   We got it changed easily to something much better, a factor of us having family occupying 3 other rooms in the hotel who had booked directly.    Booking direct with the hotel would not have cost us more and would have given us many more options based on our understanding.   VERDICT - would have been better booking the hotel ourselves.TRANSFER to/from airport - well, what appeared on the listing to be a convenient transfer service direct to hotel turned out to be a coach which spent the thick end of 90 minutes crawling from hotel to hotel until it finally reached ours.    We used a taxi from hotel to airport on the way back - only cost 21 Euro and took 15 minutes.   VERDICT - would have been hugely better off just doing this ourselves.Overall Lastminute.com was a bizarre wrapper around low quality versions of what we could easily have done ourselve.Will not, ever, use them again.

Amy,£800 out of pocket,"Had to cancel the holiday that we were looking forward to for previously unscheduled medical issues. We were very upset but understood that the cost of the flight was non refundable. We had already been refunded cost of seats as lastminute had had an issue booking them -potentially overbooked? However we had paid the additional fee so that the hotel was fully refundable for free. We cancelled online but didn't receive a cancellation confirmation email and when we rang phone line the holiday had not been cancelled and so had to do this over the phone. I phoned customer service multiple times to request a breakdown of the invoice so that we would be able to work out how much we should be receiving as a refund. I was told i would receive this in 3-5 working days via email. The first time this did not arrive. Second time an invoice arrived but was just a total amount, 3rd time after again requesting a broken down, separated invoice for hotel flights etc received the same total cost again. I then emailed them back to be told could not provide any kind of breakdown. I phoned customer services again and requested to speak to a manager and was told someone would ring within 48 hours. No one rang.  We then had had enough and so decided that would just take the refund offered so went on email. The options offered on the cancellation email were 'travel voucher' or other options so went to press other options button and 'somehow'(potentially my fault) accepted travel voucher. This then automatically gave travel voucher without even having to log in or any kind of double step confirmation. There was no security bridge at all for such a large amount of money. Within 5 minutes I rang customer services to explain mishap and wad told no way that this could be undone/changed and that now couldn't receive a refund for 6 months. When asked to speak to manager told no one available, could not tell me when would be available and didn't offer any kind of call back/further options other than to escalate to a formal complaint.

When we arrived on the 3rd June 2022, I received a devastating phone call to say my father had been taken gravely ill, and I needed to return home ASAP.The hotel were brilliant, very sympathetic and understanding to my predicament, and contacted Last Minute by email right away to have our money refunded as a gesture of good will by the hotel.I received an email from Last Minute to say the refund was being processed and would be complete within the next 7 days.The refund has ever materialised.I have made several phone calls to Last Minute, all call handlers were clearly reading from a script and kept telling me the money was still with the hotel and that it’s the hotels responsibility to refund me - NOT TRUE!!!I contacted the hotel and the Manager was again brilliantly helpful, and disgusted to hear we had not received our refund as he requested by email on 3rd June 2022.He emailed Last Minute again to enforce the request. He then emailed me the email trail as evidence of his request, which clearly states the money had been sent back to Last Minute on the 3rd June 2022.On my last phone call to Last Minute I informed the call handler that I would be requesting my credit card company to intervene to retrieve my money by doing a chargeback.The call handler asked me to wait on the line, and then came back advising me that if I did that, then the refund process would cease. I told the call handler this was not true.I felt the call handler was clearly trying to INTIMIDATE me with the use of a VEILED THREAT.I have now asked my credit card company to assist in the retrieval of my money as is my right.What a disgusting way to treat customers. It is a breach of my rights to the refund that was approved by the hotel at what was a personally devastating and distressing time for me.It would appear that Last Minute are holding onto my money just so they can profit from the interest, or not give me my money back at all, hoping I will give up on the fight for what is rightfully mine.I will continue the fight but will never use Last Minute .com ever again.Last Minute.com have caused me severe stress and anxiety at what was an already hugely distressing and devastating time.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,04 August 2022

My trip to Morocco was cancelled as the country stopped UK travel. I received a partial refund from Lastminute.com, but a large part of my trip was not refunded for no good reason.

JT,Slopiest Shoulders of them All,"I had a flight to South Africa from UK with a stop-over, received an email from Lastminute.com saying ""your flight has been cancelled"", shortly before departure. I wrote back about my flights, when COVID Restrictions started, and they confirmed the airline has cancelled my flights. Said in writing that with my approval they will request a refund - I agreed.A day later and close to departure I send another email to this address letting them know I'm still getting notifications to arrive on time for Departure, atttaching what I thought was erroneous notifications but I never heard back (and tried again and again to the same email to clarify but never heard back). Months later I wrote to them again about my refund (£365.58) back from £1,178 paid for a return flight to SA when I found out only the return leg from SA was cancelled! I also found notifications generated from another system, in SPAM confirming my flight from MAnchester still departs.Aside from the fact I would not get on a flight knowing I won’t be able to fly back to the UK (this was amidst all uncertainty going on at the time, COVID restrictions Dec 2021) - I could have changed my flight easily as my ticket was premium i.e. FullFlex – or simply rebooked my ticket for another date when things settle down.I am still trying (we're in August 2022 now) to get some money back, but they take no accountability for this and competely ignore my emails and the confusion they caused.Obviously there isn't an option to rate them lower, but if there was they so deserve that - flippant at best, not wirth the effort this lot.Avoid Lasminute.com like the plaque, I will never do business with them again.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,04 August 2022

M F,ZERO STAR. DO NOT BOOK.,"This business is a scam. Do not book. I do not recommend. I had my original flight cancelled, it took them weeks to find me an alternative one. In fact until a few days before my original departure date. When I was offered one I accepted it straight away, however it was never confirmed. I kept calling the customer care (PLEASE NOTE it takes good 5-10mins or even more to actually speak to an operator, after a series of automated messages/listening to annoying music), several times a day, and was repeatedly told to ‘wait’. On the day before my flight date, there was still no update from them. It was supposed to be a morning flight so I gave one more call before their closing time, and was told I ‘could go to the airport to find out (whether I have my flight)’ ?!?!?!?! I was moving to another country so I had everything arranged around that date, I really had to go. I went to the airport hoping for the best but it turned out there was no such booking, or even flight scheduled. I had never, ever experienced anything like this with flights. I kept calling the customer care from the airport but I was again told to ‘wait for an update’. I was speechless. I could go on for this awful experience (especially with big suitcases well over 100kg and a child). I ended up paying well over 3000 pounds to secure another flight on the spot. There was no compensation, or apology from the company. PLEASE DO NOT BOOK WITH LASTMINHTE.COM.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,04 August 2022

I have been chasing this since mid July. I declined the alternative flight they had offered because I've paid for 4 nights and I won't be getting my money's worth.They kept on insisting I wait for a resolution but now there's two days left. The agents on the phone kept saying not to worry, it will be sorted. It looks like they stopped taking inbound calls because they'll force you to go on their website (this will be due to MANY unhappy customers). I went to online chat. I would get the same response and kept being told it will be escalated. Sometimes the agents online would close the chat on me numerous times. Today (on chat) I had to stay and force the agent in the name of Artur, to cancel my booking, refund me my money of just over £1000.00 and get a manager call back. I spoke to a manager who was devoid of empathy and understanding. Sounding like a robot, she would tell me what her processes are like in the business and why they have not responded (incompetence). She suggested that I should've waiting longer despite trying to get this sorted out since mid July and with only 2 days left. She suggested they offered an alternative flight (implying I should have taken it) but what she fails to understand that it was not a solution. She said my refund will either take 5 days, 7 days, 2 weeks or up to 3 weeks depending when they get my money offering no assurances.

Further to this the original flight still went and I saw it land while waiting at security after I’d landed.

We are now 48 hours away from our travel date, and have no accommodation for ourselves and our three young children. The phone agents don’t do anything to help, except to advise to wait 3 days for an update as they are “escalating” your query, which rarely comes. An alternative was offered but it did not meet our requirements, and since then they have not done anything to get this sorted.

USE THEIR SERVICE IF YOU LIKE UNKNOWLEDGEABLE COLLEAGUES WHO HANGS UP WHEN ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE.This is the most worst travel agent i have booked my tickets from and i have learned one thing from this experiencing that its always good to book tickets directly from the airlines. They were not able to handle a simple cancellation request and advised to speak with the airlines directly. They have no knowledge of what they are doing and seems like bunch of unprofessional people working from home and scamming people of their hard earned money. They will lie to your face that they have tried  contacting the airline and cancellation is not possible as where when i contact the airlines its a different story. Cancellation can only be done from the travel agent as tickets were not purchased directly from the airlines and the airlines confirmed with an email that my request to cancel a ticket for a passenger is not an issue at all but the request needs to be made by the travel agent. They tried to charge me nearly £4000 for a date change and this is why i decided to cancel the ticket but that turned out to be the most painful experience in my life.

I receive a confirmation email for one more night at the hotel for €135 and I accepted.Last minute confirmed with me I will receive an email with a new booking shortly with the extended night. After a few days I called asking, why has there not been any confirmation, they said say not to worry everything is in order it’s just taking a bit of time and I am not the only customer they have to deal with, I realise days are going by and I am starting to get worried, I would call every 3 to 4 days asking the same question and keep telling me the same thing.We are supposed to be going to Paris on 28th July, and just a few days before I called again they said the same thing, the very next day which was yesterday the 25th July I received an email with a new price for that extra night asking if I will accept!! I called straight away trying to find out what in the world is going on!! told me the new price for that extra night is over €700!! All of this was happening within a few days of travel and everything is already in order and catered for. Then called the hotel directly in France, the hotel confirmed they have never given last minute such price, and it was a good thing I called because the room was about to be booked out!! basically that €700 last minute mentioned, the hotel in Paris confirmed it does not exist and never did!! I then booked with them directly for just under €200. I do not wish for anyone else to go through the level of stress last minute has put my family and I through.Please consider taking your business elsewhere, there are better professionals out there that will handle your booking with none of the above issues.All the phone calls was recorded if anyone would like to look into this as evidence.Sincerely Mr H Alexander07535 167 163",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,26 July 2022

However, what is even worse is that instead of fixing the root cause, the CUSTOMER CARE (really?) team pushed back stating it is mentioned in the e-mail. Yes, I saw later that it was mentioned on the BOTTOM of the e-mail. However, the point is not this. The point is that it`s totally confusing, it is not straighforward and seems like a trap to take customer`s money. I`m sorry, but that is how it looks like. It`s really a pity that instead of working backwards to fix the problem in it`s root and prevent same bad experience to happen with other customers, the CUSTOMER CARE (really?) department pushes back stating that it was mentioned on the BOTTOM of the e-mail.

Because of that, I was charged 110 GBP, as can be seen in the receipt file attached. Clearly, either LastMinute did not send my email to RyanAir, which caused me not to be able to login (in this case, I would expect a reimbursement from LastMinute) or RyanAir came out of the blue with another email to assign the reservation (in this case, I would expect a reimbursement from RyanAir). In none of these cases, I was expected to know that an email field would mean a fake sequence of characters and not my real email, which I got the reservation confirmation from LastMinute.com. I would strongly consider this as an opportunity to improve the service, addressing the root cause of the issue. I would suggest both LastMinute and RyanAir to work together to prevent such issues to your customers and time lost by your customers submitting complaints and by your staff answering them, due to inefficient process that almost seem like a trap.

I then got a phone call 20mins before the 24hr cut off from someone and there was a language barrier. Asked for someone to call me back and now the 24hr cut off has passed. All I got was excuses and “sorry you need to call the airline” “we’ve been trying but had no response” - if you knew this with the flight being so near WHY did you not update me so I could take charge and contact them myself! Furthermore they took 0 responsibility and said my request for flight change was rejected due to no flights but again nobody contacted me to advise this so I could ask for alternative dates!

James Archer,Disappointed,"I was under no allusions when booking this hotel.  I knew it was a going concern. It’s currently run by a skeleton crew doing the bare minimum.It’s clean and tidy. Yes paint is flaking off the outside and it has seen better the days. The bed in the room was hard but comfortable. And shower and basin and toilet all worked well with hot and cold water. The breakfast was of a good standard and very tasty. And the view was amazing and worth it. However would have liked the choice of an early breakfast at 7am as I was running in a race at 9am. Even if that was just cereal.The bad pointsRandom signs everywhere saying how things were closed and not working. No food in restaurant, but I knew that. The Leisure centre was open but the pool was not headed and too cold to swim. This may have been mentioned but I missed it, I was disappointed as the pool was the selling point for me booking here. The sea was warmer. Same with all the plumbing, steam room was closed, sauna however worked! Outside pool empty of watt and closed. Cars abandoned everywhere rather than in the car park.The notices up everywhere where standard print at home signs. Nothing from an official hotel point of view with no logo. There was no information booklet in the rooms.Standard room price for sea view was £109. I added on breakfast.  Personally I think it was worth closer to £50-90. But location location location.  So I’m not going to complain about the price. But I will score it according so others know what to expect.",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,20 July 2022

Basically I am being the agent getting in touch with the airline becuase they don't seem to be bother doing it. When asking on information on when was the last time they tried to contact them they could not offer me any information. So I asked how do I even know you are trying to contact them? How are you trying to contact them? Through which channels? When was the last attempt?

Despite 4 phone calls, 2 emails and virtual chat yesterday (which were all totally useless and no help at all) they were unable to sort out our return flight or even update us on this.So our return flight was changed in April and they never confirmed it with the airline despite an email saying if no contact from us in 48hrs they would accept the changes for us.No further contact from them until we contacted them when we noticed that we had no flight on klm website for last leg of journey home. Still showing old flight on lastminute.com app (still showing cancelled flight as being a valid flight as I write this despite this flight being cancelled in April).  I just presumed they would have updated flight details and stupidly thought they would have done what they promised in email in April.On phone yesterday they offered us to try and get alternative flight but gave us wrong flight times. I told them the correct times for that flight number and they were supposed to try and get us on that flight. No further contact (despite me emailing and then phoning to get an automated message that then cuts you off).Then to top it all off I get an email from them today stating that not their issue and I need to contact airline myself (email sent after I am supposed to be on my holiday).So second holiday this year for us cancelled. Definitely all @lastminute.com to blame.  There is no fault of airline KLM Royal Dutch Airlines who notified last minute of the change back in April and only wish I had booked direct with them!Will never use last minute again and now fighting for a refund from them.

Mr Huw Roberts,A travel company run and staffed by clowns.,"Booked a package thro LM. About two weeks before the outward and return flights out of Stanstead I was informed my flight had changed to leave from Gatwick but to return to Stanstead. I contacted LM about this indicating that this would create real issues for me since I intended to travel to the airport by car.LM then said that they would get back to me within a week to tell me what my alternatives were. After a week I called LM numerous times only to be told that they were working on it and to be patient. Two days before the holiday I received an e mail stating my original flights were confirmed and my boarding passes were on their way. Therefore on the strength of this I booked a hotel with parking for the night before the outward leg of the holiday. I continued to check the holiday status and LM continued to confirm the booking as was originally paid for. It was only on the morning of the flight when the boarding passes had not come through that I contacted the airport directly, only to be told the outward flight had been cancelled. I called LM only to be told the same. At no time did LM think or bother to tell me. Whilst I did get a refund for the flights and the holiday hotel at no time did LM entertain a refund for the out of pocket expenses for the airport hotel, parking and the 280 mile wasted round trip to and from home to the airport hotel. LM claimed they were not aware in time that the flight had been cancelled and as such were unable to tell me in time.Who are they kidding! They knew full well and in plenty of time. However, their incompetence and totally inept customer care failed to contact me in good time to avoid my unnecessary expenses, north of £200.They are a joke of a company who deliberately make challenges to their practice difficult.Two tips.1) Avoid using these clowns unless you have no other options.2) If you do deal with them check everything, believe nothing they say, particularly concerning the flights. They are quick to shift the blame to the airlines but slow to accept their own responsibilities as a tour operator.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,19 July 2022

Ms Williams,Use this company if you love losing money,"I'm sure they're fine if nothing goes wrong with your travel plans (ie you book your holiday/flight with them and never have actually have to deal with them or speak to them or make any out of the ordinary requests), but the whole point of this company is to take your money and provide you no service or protection if something goes wrong. We booked flights which ended up being nonrefundable and nonamendable, but this information was strangely absent from all the correspondence we had from lastminute and from their website. When our daughter got chicken pox and we couldn't fly, we spent 4 days desperately trying to get staff to help us - staff that kept giving us wrong information about how to cancel or amend, which ended up *not being possible*. A horrible situation was made long and torturous due to their appalling customer service and their insistence that you are not an individual and do not deserve specialsied service. So if you love the idea of gambling on whether you get to fly or whether or you'll just be left hugely out of pocket, this is the company for you.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,18 July 2022

Same answer, over, and over, and over again. I called EasyJet who proceeded to tell me they haven’t actually received a flight request from Lastminute for that day, in my name. They also explained requests are dealt with pretty much immediately, so they’re baffled as to why they don’t have anything on record for me. Less than 48 hours and nothing.

As the flights were then all booked up, they sent me an email to say the trip was completely cancelled and I may only be refunded for the return flight (despite them cancelling both legs of the journey). When I called to question this, I was then told I wouldn’t receive a refund on the flexibility I purchased. I would understand if this was because I had changed the flight myself, but seeing as this was out of my control and due to the cancellation from the airline, I should be entitled to a full refund. The person on the phone was very rude, kept interrupting and patronising me, giving the same awful excuse every time about it being policy.

Fortunately, I did take screenshot of that error when that happened and forwarded to them. They know that their website errored out and it was the glitch in their website, still they refused to honour my refund and basically penalizing me for the fault in their website. I believe their website is not secure and I don't feel confident of putting my payment card details on their website again. If a website crashes at the time your payment is being processed, your payment details could be compromised. So BE VERY CAREFUL when putting your payment details on their website.

We were told to send her passport photo over to make the change.We did this immediately and then were told to wait up to 4 days. 6 days later we finally had an email to confirm the price to change, which we paid and then were told to wait again another 4 days.This went on and on. I called and chased multiple times to try to speed up but the phone lines kicked me off without letting me speak to a person, or when I emailed they just replied and asked to wait patiently.Finally the payment went through and we checked our account only to find that they had taken an extra £347.52 for the flight change but not added the baby!Lastminute.com now say that they cannot add the baby and that only British Airways can do that. BA say that they cannot add the baby, only lastminute.com can.

Dzhansu Yumerova,"Very disappointed service, awful experience for me","I bought (10th) a flight tickets from British Airways via lastminute.com. Why my experience is awful with them?lastminute.com offers you a flexible ticket (you pay extra of course) so in case something goes wrong you can change your ticket but still pay the difference. Something went wrong with my ticket. I clicked on 10:30 am(departure) option to catch my friends wedding in the evening. Somehow it lead me to 18:15, it was a stressful day so I realised this 5 minutes after purchasing the ticket ( got confirmation). Thankfully I bought flexible one so I called them directly they raised urgent ticket for me, also online request created -10th of July- I had to wait to hear from them - 10th to 11th- They sent me invoice i accepted to pay £24 difference (you can do this via confirmation button) -11th- The other day they called me to say price has been changed they need to confirm I missed the call -12th (you can’t call them back it’s always busy I called support team many time to request callback from that team who manage tickets)- Received an email that says there is no available ticket for 10:30 -13th (there was tickets btw I checked so called them again)- Finally I made the team call me back after multiple try and they told me I have to pay £331.80 instead £24 if I ask return they will give me back £100. When I asked why they are charging me more than BA website difference, the answer was it’s our platform where BA tells us the difference so she was checking there. I thought they had to reach out to me to get my card details that’s why me clicking yes I accept £24 difference button did it work for them. After confirming that I will pay ( as I have other chance other than not going to wedding and losing £1291) she charged my card straight away so no, card details was not the problem. So not sure what’s this button for, she said to confirm, well if confirming would not work and not enough still not sure why this is for.It’s not just me being very sad or angry here, it’s not the reason I’m typing this, but be aware of what this flexible option covers for you and how long it can take to reach out their customer service and get things done, awful experience for me. It was my whole budget for the wedding that means I will have very difficult time. I won’t use them again, not even just them I literally lost my trust to all 3rd parties. Just makes everything difficult. And I don’t believe it’s my problem their customer service or waiting periods to be slow.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,14 July 2022

Stefan Potter,AVOID booking with lastminute.com!,"AVOID booking with lastminute.com!! Especially while airlines are struggling. Booked a return flight to Madrid - flight out was cancelled with plenty of notice, i was reserved onto an earlier flight but i received no notification, so i came to get my boarding pass the day before flight, only to find out that my rearranged flight had left. On talking to customer support, they just argued that an email was sent so it was tough luck. I can't prove the non existence of an email, but i do have proof that their systems are broken - i checked high and low through my emails for this mysterious notification, only to find nothing. However, I did find a boarding pass that their system managed to fabricate a whole month before my flight was due to fly.No rearrangement of flight offered, no chance at a refund - computer said something so it's tough, must be my fault, and i was told so in no uncertain terms. I find another flight, but i'm out of pocket £255 booking that one.To add insult to injury my flight home was cancelled a day before it was due to fly. I called customer service once more and again was met with an unhelpful assistant that bluntly told me that their computer system didn't have any record of my flight being cancelled so it was tough - nothing she could or would do. No offer of alternative flight no offer of refund. When no help was forthcoming - i requested a full refund. I then had hostile attitude back telling me i'd have to wait for an email response and with no information about how long i'd have to wait. So once again i had to find another flight myself to get home - another £160 for a flight to a different UK airport due to unavailabilty and £80 in train fares to get back to my car.How lastminute.com concluded things - i got an email with notification of a refund being processed... for £3.81 - yes you read that right. Cancelled flight with no notice and I get £3.81 because the flight was booked through this terrible company.

Ian Wright,DO NOT USE,"I booked 4 passengers a flight from JFK - AMS - MME four months ago, 7 months in advance. Now they tell me the connecting flight has changed and we wont be able to make the connection. They tell you to Contact Virgin Atlantic the flight operator. When you contact Virgin they refuse to do anything as they say you have to use the travel agent; (Lastminute.com) to change the flight. Lastminute.com tell me the only option is for me to cancel the flights and 'hopefully' get a refund in 2 months!The original cost of the flights was £1264 as I booked early. To book similar Flights now is £2520 DOUBLE THE PRICE! Personally I think there is some sort of scam going on where airlines are cancelling/changing flights so customers have to rebook at a much inflated price to counter the increase in jet fuel over the last few months. Lastminute have not tried to book a new flight for us and they know they are obliged to, they are telling you the only option is to cancel, once you have cancelled you don't have a leg to stand on regards compensation etc. I really do hope they go out of business and all the employees get jobs with more reputable travel agents.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,13 July 2022

He promised me to do that for me and that I would get a response within 28 days.

Lee Bradbury,Theft of over £600,"Only giving this company 1 star because it doesn't let you give them zero. From the beginning I regretted booking my flights through this company. The website operates so slow and I constantly got error messages when trying to head over to the manage my booking section.I wanted to access this section to book my seats as it was a long flight to Canada, however the option was 'greyed' out saying I couldn't book seats and would have to call customer services to do so. After being on hold for 40 minutes I gave up and so failed to secure seats. I overlooked this inconvenience though as at least I had flights booked.I then received an email from lastminute explaining one of my flights had been changed and my itinerary was no longer valid. After seeing that one of my flights had essentially been cancelled and I would have to plan a whole new trip which last minute offered no help with, I decided to cancel the flight and book with a better company.I expected to see some charges for my cancellation such as an admin fee, but I paid £850 for my flights and was offered £171 as a refund. Absolutely disgusting. Actual robbery. How can there be any justification for keeping that amount of my money? The flights aren't until Feb 2023 so not exactly a last minute cancellation and it was because my itinerary was no longer valid!! Lastminute offered no help other than repeating how it was out of their hands as they're just a third party seller. Really poor service. I threatened to complain to the relevant ADRs and the CAA which I'm now in the process of doing and all of a sudden they changed their tune saying they would review the case and get back to me in 7 days. I've even got in touch with Rip Off Britain! However, I've had nothing back from them other than a repeat of the ridiculous refund offer which I will not accept. Really, really disappointed that businesses can just take so much money from people despite them being the ones who have breached the contract of sale and offer zero help whatsoever.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,09 July 2022
Ellie H,A positive experience of lastminute.com,"I booked flights and car hire through lastminute. They took the payment, and then I was told that the car hire would be confirmed in 72 hours. A week passed with no confirmation, so I rang their customer service line for clarification as to why it had not been confirmed. They said the issue was with the car hire company and they would contact them seeking further clarification. Another week passed and still nothing. I rang again and asked that my car hire be canceled. They processed my request straight away, and the money was back in my account in a few days. My experience of their customer service was very positive. I only had to wait a few minutes each time before I got through to speak to someone, and they dealt with my requests very quickly.

In the end turns out they never put the refund request in to the hotel / airline and refused to acknowledge this or try and resolve it (customer services team are useless - if i asked a question in the chat about progress with my refund they would often end the conversation and not respond).

Lorna M,"Terrible, completely incompetent","Would never book through lastminute again. My flights were cancelled due to the SAS strike. I called them and they kept telling me my flights were going ahead even though I had received an email from SAS and could see on the flight status on SAS website that they were cancelled. I had a tour booked on the opposite side so a change in dates was not suitable for me. Was told id be called back, they never rang. Had to contact them for hours and repeatedly explain that my flight was cancelled to THEM, they kept telling me to contact the airline, but the airline said they cannot assist as booking was done through lastminute. After all this I keep getting emails to say as i have accepted the flight change they will look for new flights, even though i specifically stated multiple times that a different date doesnt suit. Impossible to deal with and absolutely useless. The small savings is not worth it. Just book through the airlines directly.update: lastminute has been attempting to take this review down saying they don't believe it's a genuine experience.

We still have not had a full refund and will not be using them again. The customer service is non existence once you have paid and most just cut you off.

I rang lastminute.com back today and they advised that they need the airline to send me an email, that I can forward on to them, confirming the above. I was on the phone over an hour to the airline, but they advised that they do not have authority to send emails or have the authority to amend my booking. They confirm that lastminute.com have complete authority to amend bookings on the portal and that a name correction shouldn’t be an issue. The handler I spoke to today advised that this is a name change and not a correction. I disagree with this as it is the same passenger flying, with the first name and date of birth. The only option I have been provided is to cancel with no refund.

I choose an option from a list of choices given by Bravofly flight search results.My option was a ticket of round trip from London to Chennai 4 pax, with a cost of 4633.05 USD.Refer to attached screenshot BravoFly.jpg, when I submitted a consent to charge me via paypal, the payment got processed to my surprise I was charged 4644.17 EUR which higher than the USD displayed on the screen refer to attached second screenshot BravoFlyPaypal.jpg.I have few concerns or frustrations on this entire transaction.1.I choose to pay via my US Paypal account as I hold a USD Credit card with me because the website displayed the total fees in USD, but the transaction was processed in EUROs without any consent from me to process it in Euros and since I used US Paypal account the currency conversion was not at the market rate instead it was paypal rate which has added to the overall price, which you can see in the second screenshot the total payment gone out from my paypal account is little more than 5000 USD.2.I was charged 4644.17 EURO which is in no way close to even market conversion of 4663.05 USD on the day 02-Jul-2022 when the sale was done3.I was not issued the tickets until now and the customer care says the tickets will be issued subject to availability with the airlines within the cost confirmed in the booking, if they are not able to get it my transaction will be cancelled and I will be issued the refund within 45 days, I have no way to book another ticket if that was the case, I neither have savings balance nor my credit card will have more limit.4. I raised a query on the USD EURO issue, customer care says they have no way to confirm if it can be looked and I will be paid difference rather says they cant confirm anything until 72 hours.I called customer care more than 10 times, got connected 3 times and spent more than 1.5 hours to explain, but there was no sympathy or empathy rather tried to dominate me, no value for my emotions, and I was really stressed and my anxiety increased.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,03 July 2022

Ant,No.6 West Coates was my worst hotel experience ever,"I stayed in Room 2 at the No.6 West Coates hotel for 1 night. I booked my stay on 9th June 2022 via lastminute.com. I arrived at the hotel at approximately 20:45 15/06/2022 and was expecting to be in bed by 21:30, knowing I had to set off early the next morning. Issues:1)	Since arriving at the hotel, it took approximately 20 minutes to get into my room: At first, the 2 members of staff communicating with me via the door buzzer were repeatedly talking over each other. It took them approximately 15 minutes to understand that I did not receive instructions on retrieving my key from the “key café”. Eventually, a member of staff provided me with instructions over the phone and I was able to retrieve my key shortly after.2)	The door to my room would not lock from the inside: Upon entering Room 2, the first thing I did was try to lock the door but it was not working. Between 21:13 and 21:43, I was communicating with the staff via WhatsApp, anticipating being moved to another room. I provided the staff with videos clearly showing that the lock was not working. The replies I got included statements such as “but it definitely works” (why did they bother asking for evidence if they were doing to dismiss it like that?). It was 21:43 when I was finally informed that no other rooms were available, so that was another 30 minutes of my evening wasted when I could have been relaxing.3)	The hot tap was extremely loud: Most of the people who watch the video I have will agree it sounds like a firework going off.4)	The boiler was quite loud: Every 5 minutes or so, the boiler started making a loud rumbling sound and the room became noticeably warmer (the room was already too warm and I had the window open and radiators off). At 23:28, I sent message via WhatsApp asking if the boiler could be turned down. They responded saying that the boiler will automatically turn off (it did turn off but only for 5 minutes).

Marissa Mangan,An absolute disgrace,"What an absolute disgrace of a ‘company’ they have scammed me out of a €900 open ticket(previous ticket had to be cancelled due to getting covid) provided and confirmed, by the airline. I tried to contact lastminute every 4 days for over 2 months to try and get the confirmation email of my changed flight (which they said would come in 4days each time) but they eventually got back to me over a month later when after a lot of time and hounding, and upset on the phone, the ‘escalated team’ let me know I needed to pay an extra nearly €350 because they couldn’t book the ticket in the time allowed by the airline, completely their fault. They used the most blatant delay tactics I have ever seen. They believe the ‘request has been managed’ and I need to ‘open a new request’. I have asked them to send me call recordings, emails from the airline etc. to take this further legally, but they have continued not to provide these to me which is illegal. They continue to push blame onto Etihad airways and myself in order to gain more money off disgruntled customers, even though it is clear in their terms and conditions that I should be able to rebook with no extra cost as it was an open booking which I tried to amend as soon as possible. In the current climate, you expect companies to support and help their customers as much as possible, but unfortunately lastminute.com have caused me nothing but stress and used distasteful tactics to suit the situation. I really urge people not to use their service, as the lack of help and support I have received is truly shocking.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,28 June 2022

Tamsin  Lindsay ,"If I could give minus 100, I would.","Booked a package holiday through LM. There were issues with the outbound flight being changed to a day earlier, yet they did not extend the hotel stay. We then found out that LM had not accepted our flight details with the airlines despite sending us multiple confirmation emails to say all changes had been accepted on our behalf. After approximately 12 hours of me chasing by email telephone and web chat I finally managed to get hold of somebody who extended the hotel stay to cover the extra night. However this lady was the only person in the whole of my experience with last-minute who knew what she was doing. On web chat when you talk to the customer care advisors, if you ask questions that they dont know the answers to they simply close the chat. This happened multiple times and I have the chat download to prove it. None of the telephone numbers work, the numbers listed online and in the passenger account section on the app go through to just two options which are either 1) check the status of my refund, or 3) get more information on our data protection and privacy. Thats right - option 2 to talk to someone has been removed completely from the options!! It is impossible to speak to somebody over the telephone. I was at my wits end with last minute. Finally got it sorted with the help of the afore mentioned lady, and then our flight was cancelled the night before takeoff by the airline. Again I tried to contact last minute and after more hours of chasing and of useless web chat, I was told that I would be contacted the same day with an alternative flight option. I heard nothing. I used web chat yet again to try and find out what was happening with our holiday, and yet again the chat was closed on me another two times. I then received an automated email to say I would receive new flight options within seven days this would have meant after our holiday had ended! So again I queried it but nobody helped. We are now in the process of trying to claim a refund and I have just been told today over web chat, that last minute are only looking at refunding the cost for outbound flight because I did not cancel the hotel or inbound flight and therefore we are classed as a no-show. Logic would assume that as it was booked as a package holiday and the outbound flight was cancelled, we would not therefore need the hotel or the inbound flight. However apparently last minute do not process refunds like this so now we have spent £1100 for nothing except headaches and stress. Their prices may seem reasonable online, however when there is a problem and invariably there will be one you will not receive any help or guidance from this company. I would recommend to everybody to AVOID last minute.com at all costs.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,27 June 2022

Ray Thomas,I would have given zero stars if I had the option,"First, let me say that I will never use this company again! I booked a stay in Crete and flights! No problem with the accommodation booking! Not so with the flights! I opted for the automatic boarding pass, save me some time I thought! How wrong was I, this was just the start of my problems. When filling in the booking there was an option for first and surnames, fair enough! However, when I went to fill in my passport details it said there must be no difference on the boarding pass. So the passport has my first, middle and surnames so I need to add my middle name to the boarding pass. Oh no! No option for that is there! SO I had to request a change to the booking! Should be done in 4 working days. A week goes by and nothing, finally I manage to talk to someone on the phone, oh yes they assure me it's all in hand! They lied! Another week goes by and another phone call, again they say it's all ok! A month goes by and nothing so I phone again! This time I got their booking number with Tui which came in handy later! They assure me that it will be sorted in the next 4 hours! No, it wasn't! I phone again and this time they manage to talk to Tui, I have to pay a three-figure sum for the details to be changed! Ok, by now I'd have done anything. The details get changed and I should have had Lastminute.com sort my boarding pass but no! Now there is a technical problem! I get an email saying I have to do it myself, luckily I had their booking number with Tui and I did the boarding passes. Hooray! However, when I get to board the plane and scan the pass it comes up with a red cross! Fortunately, the lady saw all the details were correct and let us pass. Obviously, I knew this would happen on the return journey so it was playing on my mind for the whole of the holiday. Sure enough, on the return, the red cross comes up! The Greek lady checked all the details and after a 10-minute delay, I think she just overrode the computer and we got on the plane. Terrible service from a rubbish company.

(I am 75 years old and need to be able to find a comfortable head position).It may have been my own fault when booking, but it made two 12 hour flights less than comfortable.I would appreciate your comments, so I can be clear about the process.Tha k you.",Rated 3 out of 5 stars,24 June 2022
Dan Woods,On line check in - underhand,Due to fly to Alicante in the morning. Had to wait until 24 hours before the flight departure to check in online. Tried to use the last minute login to do this but this login doesnt work. You need a login from the airline that they dont send you. We had to ring a premium rate airline customer service number at a cost of circa £40 to be told that we would have to check in at the airport at a further cost as the on line check in was not an option. Rang last minute customer service and was shouted at down the line and told it was my fault for trying to check in within 24 hours. But this is what was stated on the booking page provided by them. Think this may be a way of trying to extract more money from innocent elderly passengers like myself. Will never use this company again. Avoid third parties and stick with reputable tour operators is my advice.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,24 June 2022

Florina Andreea,Terrible flight booking experience,I have booked a flight recently via lastminute. As it is summer flight prices are increasing every day so I was happy to lock in the price as we booked for a family of 5. Lastminute cancelled the booking after two days saying that the booking couldn't be confirmed. Ended up re-booking the flights directly with the company and paying 300 GBP more because of their mistake. Would have cancelled the whole trip but we had already paid for the hotel trusting the flight is booked. They are a reap off!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,23 June 2022

Not only that, but only one voucher can be used on any booking - even at the inflated price.....after months of searching I finally bit the bullet, paid the premium overcharge and used my credit to book flights. I notice that Lastminute are never cheapest option so guess they're trying to recoup on COVID losses. I can't recommend, will never be scammed into taking credit option again (I'll take cash refund), and I'll never use again - even though that means I'll forfeit a remaining £30 voucher.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,23 June 2022

Nguyet Nguyen,If I could give this company a minus…,"If I could give this company a minus star, I would. I read all the bad reviews yet I decided to ignore them. Bad decision!I booked an international air ticket from Vietnam to the US (which has three legs) on May 3, and also paid for some fancy ""premium package"" (it just means they'd prioritize your inquiries if you have a question). By May 25 they cancelled the longest leg of my trip. The email I received simply said something like, ""your flight, number... from... to..., has been cancelled. Go to lastminute.com for details."" I go to the website. The only way to contact them is online chat! (If you are lucky, one of the agents will give you a phone number for you to call, but it's a Brit number and NOT a toll-free, so if you are from a different country, god help you!)The agent I chatted with told me that within a week they would send me an alternative trip (with all three legs) either on the same day or plus/minus one day. I was ok with that. One week passed. Nothing. I contacted them again, and was told ""your requested is being managed with highest priority, please wait."" I exited and chatted with several other agents, all of whom gave me more or less the same version of the above sentence. 2 weeks later, nothing. I contacted them again. This time something else happened. One of them told me that the first agent gave me the wrong information, that only the cancelled portion would be replaced, and it's my responsibility to match it with the rest two legs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And if/when they give me the alternative flight, and I want to refuse it, I will get refunded only for the cancelled portion!One of them told me that my request was ""expedited"" and I would receive the alternative TRIP (with all three legs) within 24 HOURS! Then one of them said that there was no such ""expedited request"" in the system and that they asked the airline and the airline hadn't responded. One of them said that they had ALREADY emailed me the alternative trip. I was stunned. So I asked them to resend me the email. It turned out it was the original booking (which had already been cancelled). Up to this point, I was fed up. I just booked another ticket, and contacted my bank to stop the payment to this scam company. This is only the summary of my nightmare that lasted 1 almost 1 months with lastminute.com. I must have chatted with about 2 doz agents, and because of the time difference, I had to time my chat, stay up late or get up early. Generally speaking, here are some details: - You will notice the funky names of the chat agents. It is likely that they are some people sitting in front of the computer in India or Pakistan. - The chat agents are useless. They don't know anything, and I don't think they can access the same information. There doesn't seem to be a centralize system of info.- There is no way to receive a transcript of your conversation with them. When they first told me that I would receive the alternative trip with all 3 legs within a week, I just it was too good to be true so I asked them to confirm, then I took pictures of the conversation. In fact, I took pictures of almost all conversations I had with them (because you cannot copy and paste the texts of the conversations for your records!). They will NOT send you the transcripts, so be sure to back up your conversations with them in case you need to dispute their charges. - I filed two complaints, one with the Customer Protection Bureau in the US, the other with the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) as this company is a member of the ABTA. Just go to ""help and complaint."" I hope by doing so, I will prevent others from falling into the same misery.So, that's that with lastminute.com. That's my absolute last (and first) time I have anything to do with them. I will update if they try to be funny and charge me in any way. If you decide to do business with them, well, good luck!",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,22 June 2022

It took 2 weeks and half for that request we were worried that as days passes ticket will be expensive so in the oast 2 weeks and half we called 3x and same response. Nothing! After 3 weeks. We got an email that they could find any available slits foor our days. It is impossible that they couldnt find other hotels  as each days were looking through last minute.  We told them we didnt mind paying more as and in the end they got us nothing. after that request we reuested a change of hotel ONLY AND THEY ASKED US TO TELL WHICH HOTEL. We told them a specific hotel (which it should not be a problem as were giving them an option already BUT we got the same response and waiting time. They dont atick to their 4 days of waiting time.

Big guy,DO NOT BOOK ANYTHING with…,"DO NOT BOOK ANYTHING with lastminute.com absolutely appalling company,  I booked a flight for the 12th of June from London Gatwick flying with scoot airlines my return flight was for the 3rd of July,So naturally I booked my taxi for the return trip. I was advised by the taxi driver to arrived early as my flight was booked for 22.05 on Sunday.I got to the airport roughly at 6.45 pm so plenty of time to check in, so I thought. I went to the service desk to ask where my check-in point was, the guy behind the counter told me I was too late and my flight leaves at 7:30. I showed him the lastminute.com app on my phone and paperwork I had printed off, my flight was quite clearly booked for 22:05. As well as being really unhelpful to me, he told me that this happens all the time with lastminute.com. With no chance of getting on the flight I called lastminute.com but no answer so I used the online chat system and explained that they had messed up my flight.The Indian guy on the chat said its not there fault and hung up the chat.by this time I was hopping mad! how dare they! I had no option but to call my taxi driver and beg him to turn around and come and get me, so I'm now out of pocket by a large amount and extremely annoyed.  I called my wife in Vietnam and told her not to get the connecting flight as I'm not going to be there. I haven't seen her since we got married because of covid, and that was 3 years ago!I got home at 10 o'clock on Sunday, utterly deflated and and very angry, I couldn't call anyone because it was so late on a Sunday night. after not sleeping at all I was up at the crack of dawn, calling my travel insurance company but they could help because it wasn't a flight cancellation. I then called lastminute.com and they said its the airlines fault for not telling them about my flight changes. the guy i spoke to from lastminute.com was extremely rude as well. I called my airline and they said they informed lastminute.com, on the 20th May at 2pm, of my flight change and sent my proof of this. I called lastminute.com again and explained to them that its their fault and they needed to get me another flight. they were extremely rude, yet again, but agreed to get me another flight as soon as possible. After 9 days and 40+ phone calls and being lied to, all their staff do not care one bit if your stranded or not.Still no flight I've lost all of my connecting flights and hotels. I'm thousands of pounds out of pocket and they do not give a damn! I'm seeking legal advice too, as its the only way they're going to listen.

Sue Matthews,Do not use. Like many customers,"Like many customers, if I could have given this cruel and heartless company zero stars, I would. We stayed at the Radisson Blu on Saturday as we were due to fly out of Stansted at 7am the following day. As for so many people, we lost our flight and rearranged for Wednesday. Consequently we needed yet another hotel stay. Foolishly, I didn’t think to check reviews for lastminute before booking the Radisson through them. I inadvertently pressed 22/7 instead of 21/7, immediately realised my mistake and called LM. Like many other people, the operatives, who obviously have DPhils in arguing, tell you they will pass on your woes and “the requests’ team” will get back. . We did have a reply, proving there is no emotional intelligence whatsoever, in this set up. The reply was ‘no’ even though the error was noticed immediately. We have rung LM numerous times since but have got nowhere with the DPhils. The Radisson Blu, who could not have been nicer, said LM had never contacted them and, yes, they did have rooms available but sadly, were unable to refund us, as LM never contacted them. It was interesting to hear that LM have been banned in France and I can only hope England will follow suit. BEWARE.

The air conditioning unit look very old, had a broken grill, and I could see that the filter was filthy - covered in a layer of grey muck. I could also see black spots on the metal grill in the air conditioning unit which looked like it could be mildew. I asked to be moved to another room, but none were available. They cleaned the filter for us, but it still smelled bad.  We thought that we could address the issue (since we couldn't move rooms) by not using the air conditioning unit (even though it was a hot summer day) and opened the doors to the balcony. Bad luck again, as our room was just next to the exhaust from the kitchen - so if we left the door open for ""fresh"" air, it smelled of grease. This was not at all what I expected of a 5 star hotel.

They sent another flight with a lay-by in Istanbul of 6 hours, which I turned down because should I have accepted it, I would have missed my friend’s wedding, which perhaps was the purpose of my travel.After 52 emails and over 60 phone calls, I was made all sort of promises concerning my departing time, which was still showing as leaving London Stansted at 22:00 on 19/06/22. This whole situation had a very impact on both myself and my partner, causing as a significant amount of stress and anxiety. With us not getting any further information for our travelling, we proceeded in going to Stansted to take the flight at 22:00 on 19/06/22.I tried checking in online but it said there was an error, I consequently contacted lastminute.com about this and they suggested that everything is fine and that I should do the checkin at the airport. At the checkin, the checkin officer at the airport also could not check as in. She stated that there is an error on the end of my agency (lastminute.com) and there is nothing they can do.Bare in mind I live in Doncaster and I travelled 3 hours 30 minutes, spending money on fuel and car park for my planned trip which lastminute.com did not maintain due diligence.This whole shenanigans has caused me alot of stress and anxiety and I angrily (and rightfully so) contacted lastminute.com for a refund.Upon the arrival of the refund, I chose the to fly to Majorca from doncaster. However with my high level of anxiety, I accidentally chose the wrong airport (Stansted instead of Doncaster/Sheffield).I am writing this complaint not only as a customer but as a human being who deserved to be at his bestfriend’s wedding with this being ab even of a lifetime.With all of this, I have lost a significant amount of money, my mental health has been significantly affected and I am potentially going to loose a childhood friend who I have known for a life time.You have lost a valuable customer who has over 100 trips with your company!!!I hope you guys are able to deal with the inconvenience and the damage cause to me. I will take legal advice and proceed further.Thank you",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,20 June 2022
Ana de las Heras,we bought tickets 6 months before,"we bought tickets 6 months before.  The flight suffered a schedule change.  British Airways has the details but tells us that we must receive the new schedules from our travel agent where we bought the tickets.  Lastminute.com, our agency, tells us that they do not have any information about it and that British Airways has no system and therefore they cannot know anything.  The solution that Lastminute.com gives us, return part of the money, money only for the modified flight.  Is this a joke?  that is, I bought flight tickets from a company that has no idea about anything, that is not responsible for anything, that does not talk to the airlines and that on top of that scams you and steals your money.  They have destroyed us emotionally, now we are left without a trip because the prices are impossible.  I have a lot of anger.  MY ADVICE: I ASK everyone that no matter how much they see the cheap prices offered by Lastminute.com, DO NOT BUY from them, because that was what happened to us, it was the cheapest and now we are left without a trip, without money, without any...",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,20 June 2022

The room [383] was a lower standard than Travelodge and essentially tatty. The window was a 70s metal window with a huge air gap at the top which I could put my fingers through and see them the other side.. no blackout blinds...no sockets either side of bed...a 'damp odour' in bathroom..window looked out onto a rooftop and wall...uncomfortable mattress... shower water was almost scalding and unable to turn it down to a bearable temperature...I would guess this is a room they only offer through online late-booking agencies hoping that the desperate punter will not say much....

I therefore requested to cancel the hotel but in order to get a refund would mean losing about £200 so I was forced to get a voucher to spend on their website.

I could not access my booking and manage it on their site as apparently they have to add the luggage on separately. This was eventually done on 16th June and we travel on 18th June. I had to contact them via chat twice to ask when it would be done. So once that was done, we were waiting to check in online as specified on my booking. I sat waiting and waiting and it was finally open. It then told me to go to the airline site which promptly told me that online check in is not available at Birmingham airport. they do not have our passport details yet so I then went on chat yet again. I explained the situation and they said I could check in and give our passport details once we got to the airport. I advised that I had never done this before and it was not normal procedure. They gave me two numbers to call as apparently they could not call me as they are a chat service! (so why ask for my number on chat saying that they may need to call me?). Anyway, I called both numbers and it said there was a problem with the system and the call was ended. I then got another number from their website and exactly the same happened. I asked on chat how this could be resolved and got the same answer as before - check in with passport details once you arrive at then airport. This is also frustrating as there are obviously issues at the moment in airports with delays and cancellations and this will make it even slower. This is such bad customer service. They could not help me. They take your money quickly enough but once they have done that it is up to you to sort yourself.

(8.June) We didn't received that email for the payment instructions or the new tickets. Instead we received an email, that the change is not possible.6. (8.June) We called. They told us, that everything is fine, there was a mistake and they will send us the tickets.7. (9.June) We received a new offer. They changed the destination and the timings, which we didn't asked for. It was for Düsseldorf International - Pescara, Italy. The timings were not suitable for our son, who is 2 years old. This time the offer was for 242€. This was bad, because we instructed them nicely on the phone. We told them exactly the flight that we wanted. Because of all these mistakes and the passing time, the price went up.8. (9.June) We called. We didnt wan't this new offer with different timings.9. (9.June) We asked for a change of date then, another option was cheaper. Again Düsseldorf Weeze - Pescara, Italy. Just 1 day later. Online the ticket was available for 130€. Again, they would send the request to the other department to check the tickets and to send us the offer.10. (9.June) We also wrote a complaint to [protected]@lastminute.de because of all the time which we were wasting just for waiting for the offer.11. (10.June) We received an email, that the change is not possible.12. (10.June) We wrote again a complaint to [protected]@lastminute.de13. (11.June) We booked those tickets which we wanted from another website and canceled what was possible. The hotel days could not be adjusted so we had to pay on top for this mistake of LastMinute. Ticketprice was 141,99€.14. (13.June) We wrote again a complaint to [protected]@lastminute.de15. (14.June) We called again. They wanted to do a new request.The problem is, that they also lied.- They told us, that they tried to call us. Not true.- They told us, that Ryanair doesn't fly from Düsseldorf Weeze, which is a joke. Of course they fly, we booked the ticket and they send us 2 offers themselves for this airport.- They told us, that Ryanair denied the request, there were no tickets. That's not true either, we could and still can purchase tickets online. And if that was the case, why offering us new tickets? Or not offering us alternatives?- The customer care does not help at all. They only give you the first name and refer you to that email, from which nobody replies.-> So why buying a flexticket if it is not flexible?-> Why having such a service, which is no help at all?-> What should we do if there is no helpline who can help us?-> We had to pay on top for the change. They dont care for this.Desired outcome: Refund for 192€ and the money, which we lost for the hotel changes, since the offer which we accepted, was not fulfilled.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,15 June 2022
Craig Pusey,If I could give 0 stars I would,"Never, ever, ever book anything with these people. I booked a surprise trip away for me and my partner in March leaving in September. Unfortunately I had to request to change the dates for the following week as she could not get the time off. I did this within the 3 day cooldown period and my booking change request showed as pending for 2 months! Within this 3 day period I tried calling them but their automated phone system cut me off as there was a pending change request. I called from an unknown number and their system didn't recognise it so it cut me off. I emailed one of their directors, their HR departments, everyone I could find an email address for to try and resolve this. they then said the hotel dates could not be changed which is a joke as there was 6 months notice. If they had said this straight away I could have cancelled and rebooked. They were impossible to contact, their online chat is a bot with no option to speak with a human. After 3 months I was finally able to speak with someone from customer services, now they've taken £180 from me and have said I would need to pay a E280 cancellation fee as it is outside the 3 day period. I have now been able to request a cancellation and have reported them to Visa for deceptive business practices, I am currently awaiting their response to the cancellation request to see what new BS they try now.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,15 June 2022

Katie,Do not book with lastminute.com,"If I could give a 0 score rating, I would.A group booking over £3500+ on flights cancelled with as little information in the email as 'your flight has been cancelled'. No explanation for this, no reasons why and very little support with the next steps.We travel in less than 7 weeks, no alternative flights have been given and we have resorted in no other option but to cancel our trip to South Africa which we have waited over a year to go on. We spoke to a very rude and unhelpful customer service representative on the phone who had no empathy for our situation and continued to blame the airline for cancelling our flight. Having accepted no alternative flights with the airline, we were looking for a speedy refund to ensure enough time to rebook flights in the next few weeks. He continued to tell us that the wait for a refund was 2 months (if not, longer!!!!!!!!) and that it could not be processed any sooner. This is ridiculous! We asked to speak to a manager/supervisor in which we were repeatedly told 'I cannot transfer the call'. No email address, no contactable phone number for a superior person and his only advise was the email the general last minute.com 'customer care' inbox. We have been left to feel devastated in this situation with absolutely no help or empathy from lastminute.com as a company. We will never be booking anything with them again and will be advising all other family/friends to do the same. Absolutely shocking customer service and customer experience.

Y Frydman,Avoid at all costs!!,"Please be extremely careful when booking anything with this company. They are absolutely crooked and will do everything in their power to hold onto your money. We cancelled a flight (with British Airways) at the end of last year and I had to chase for 4 months to get a voucher code - which then didn't work! BA was unable to help me as LM had done the actual booking and payment so I was stuck between the two and LM refused to help me by following up to check the codes. Eventually BA has made a blanket policy decision to refund all existing vouchers to customers, which means that LM was refunded the cost of our tickets. Obviously that money has NOT been forwarded onto us by LM (approx £1,000). The call centre staff has clearly been given a script from which to read and is of zero assistance whatsoever. Avoid this company at all costs, this was a huge mistake which we will not repeat.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,14 June 2022

Sofie,They do not adhere to their own T&Cs and policies.,"Booked flights to and from Copenhagen for four people in 2021. On 11.03.22 all flights were changed significantly by more than a day either side. We were given the option to request an alternative flights if we did not wish to accept the change, which we did. We should have been informed of the change within 7 days. After 4 phone calls, and hours on hold, we finally got through to Lastminute.com on Monday 2nd May (Spoke to Bella, approx time 11:30 and 12:00). Over 8 weeks after we should have received alternative flights, we were informed there were no suitable alternatives. Our only option was to accept a refund, which we did. Bella confirmed that the full amount £713.54 would be refunded to the card I paid with, within 2 months. I double checked it would be the full amount, to my bank and not a voucher, she confirmed this was correct.Today (14.06.22) I was sent a refund email. I followed this link and the cash refund offered is £542, a loss of just over £171. Apparently a handling fee is applied to cash refunds (£105.00), however, the other £66 is simply 'lost'. I am unsure why I would be charged a handling fee, when the T&Cs state that this is applied when customers cancel flights, but in this case the airline/Lastminute.com did. Considering the poor service received up until now, the lies I have been told, and the hours I have put into 'handling' this, this fee is even more shocking.   I started a chat with 'Nish' to explain these points and he told me that they had no record of any of my calls and that I am only entitled to £542. When I asked to raise a complaint or for someone to call me, he ended the chat with no explanation. I was cut off.I proceeded to call Lastminute.com again. I spoke to Marlon at approx. 10:50am. He was polite (unlike Nish who was consistently rude/unhelpful), but unfortunately, he could not help me. He also confirmed that I could only get a refund of £542, and could not explain why £171 has been deducted. He suggested I opt for a flight voucher for £660 and a £30 travel credit voucher, to reduce my overall loss. After all the points raised above, is this really acceptable? I have no intention of using a voucher, I do not wish to be a customer of Lastminute.com again, and I was repeatedly assured that a full refund would be paid into my bank. Marlon essentially ended the phone call by telling me that there is nothing he can do and that he will inform the team that I am unhappy. I have notes on all my telephone conversations (which the company should also record), a transcript of my conversation with Nish, and all of the emails (with dates showing the company does not adhered to the policies outlined within the T&Cs).I will send this information to the complaint email, to which I am told they can take up to 28 days to reply to. This organisation is shocking. There is no customer care and I am being completely robbed/ripped off.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,14 June 2022

Davies,Booking cancelled without my permission,"I've booked tickets to fly from Melbourne to London leaving this Saturday, 18th of June. As you can imagine, this is my first trip back home to see my family in 3 years. It's not only a very exciting and highly anticipated trip, it also holds a lot of emotion given the context of the last 3 years.Last night I contacted Bravofly using their live chat function to ask some questions about check-in and baggage. The live chat agent randomly cut the connection midway through the conversation, so I started a new one and got the answers I was looking for. A short time later I received an email from Bravofly saying that they had cancelled my booking and had requested that a refund be processed. I then received a further email a short time after that from lastmninute.com advising that my request to cancel my booking had been processed. At no point in any of my interactions had I asked for them to cancel my booking.I then immediately went back onto live chat and asked for someone to call me. I was provided with a number for the lastminute.com group to call, so I placed a call to them. I spoke to an agent who told me that I must have requested the cancellation and that there was no error on their end. The agent from the live chat had made a note that I had requested the cancellation. I told the agent that this is strictly not the case and I need my flight reinstated immediately. He refused, stating that I had made the request or someone has obtained my details and made the request on my behalf. I asked to speak to his manager, he said that they were all in meetings and that he would request a callback. I refused to accept this, and the agent ended up cutting the call.I then called again and spoke to another agent. She essentially told me the same thing but put in a request for the management to look into it and get back in touch. The time frame she provided was 48 hours, which I explained was unacceptable given I was meant to be flying in 4 days time. She said that she would leave a note but there was nothing she could do. Again, I asked to speak to a manager there and then, but she said that she has no managers...I have sent Bravofly and Lastminute.com several email and have posted/spammed their social media, and have had no responses. I can easily go online and book a new flight with a different company, however it is going to cost almost double the original cost and I have no idea if my flight is going to be reinstated. I don't want to book another flight and not need it.I think clearly what has happened is the live chat agent left my booking open when speaking with another customer, cancelling my booking thinking it was theirs. The fact that the company has immediately told me I must have done this and not even tried to fix the problem I think amounts to an attempt to gaslight me - but at best is just really bad customer service.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,14 June 2022

The outbound flight on the 12th was cancelled a couple of hours before it was meant to depart. I called them and they said I had 2 options, rearrange the outbound flight or get a refund just for the outbound flight( I would still be charged for the return flight). I opted to reschedule and they offered me a flight on the 14th( my break is really just one day at this point) I didn’t want to loose my return so I accepted. They told me I’d get an email with my itinerary shortly, that didn’t happen, the next day on the 13th I call again to ask what’s going on( by this time I’d checked they’re website and alternative flight was no longer available) and this time I was offered a refund and told they can’t ask for an alternative flight because it’s been more than 24h since my flight( even though I had requested this, been offered one and accepted it the previous morning). I asked to speak to a manager several times( I must have spoken to 8 different people) none of them agreed to put me through to anyone and said that they have escalated the problem and a manager would be in touch. I would receive a generic email from the ‘manager’ every time saying they will get back to me within 4 days and they are waiting to hear from the airline) The customer service is appealing, they don’t listen, they don’t care, you are not able to speak to any of their superiors and they just make things up as they talk. I couldn’t contact the airline because I didn’t have an account with them to manage my booking and had to go through lastminute.com for them to act on my behalf.

Being dyslexic I missed this very easy mistake to make. This means I've lost money and they're hiding behind terms and conditions and what they say is the airlines policies. I expect to be able to make a decision to return something within a couple of minutes and not be penalised for it. Not to have my disability held against me.

They were inflexible for a travel agency who made changes to the booking, literally, ‘last minute’.There also did not offer compensation so I had to pay an additional €180 for a two-hour airport transfer from Heraklion Airport to Chania after they made a bungle of my flight booking! They told me I can book the airport transfer myself through their website and didn’t even offer to do it for me! I learnt my lesson and did not book the airport transfer from their website and booked it directly with Heraklion Taxi company and it was a good decision as they were more professional than Lastminute.com staff! Lastminute.com travel agent even lied on the phone and said Heraklion Airport is not far from Chania and was less than an hour by taxi and said he was from Crete! We requested the phone transcription of the conversation I had with them but they never emailed it over like they promised and gave me a run around that I can get it from their website. It’s disgraceful but we could not get a full refund so we end up going and paying the extra!I will NEVER again book through lastminute.com even if they offer the cheapest holiday because they are not only dishonest but you will end up paying more as they have the worst travel agent service I’ve ever come across!",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,12 June 2022
Anne Garrard,Rome,I took a short break to Rome where i have always wanted to go.The hotel - Diana Roof Garden is situated in an idea position for a holiday to see the sites of Rome.The hotel is clearly recovering from covid suffering various functional issues in rooms - but saying that the staff were very attentive and moved me to better rooms. Also the restaurant on the roof is delightful and has a great menu.I would stay there again due to the great staff.I flew with Ryanair and was shocked at their lack of due care and attention to covid prevention measures. Rome airports and Stansted airport also equally lax on covd prevention - especially when hurded like cattle through the section to the passport control in close spaces for long period of time. (I have travelled several times since lockdown being lifted and have remained covid free until i used Ryanair and Stansted airport) i tested positive for covid on my return to uk and after being pinged that i had been exposed on 5th June - the day i flew!!!,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,12 June 2022

Telephoned LM.com for assistance to be told my flight had been cancelled several days previously and they would provide an alternative flight for me. I had (and still have) not received confirmation or communication from either LM.com or TUI regarding this. Could not call again as my number had been logged and algorithmically filtered to an automated message. Contacted LM.com via chatbot a couple of hours later for an update and was informed my flight had not been cancelled. Managed to get a taxi to Manchester airport (30 miles away) and was told by check-in desk flight HAD been cancelled.On returning home 21/2 hours later, I had 5 follow up 'conversations' over the ensuing 3 days, being told categorically my issue had been escalated to management each time and they would contact me with alternative arrangements by COB each day which again never happened. This all ended, after quoting Travel ... Regulations 2018 at them, in a refund ... NOT for the full amount I had paid for the entire package, which in an email they stated I would be receiving. TOP TIP. Do Not purchase any add-ons to your package as they will NOT be refunded. Will most definitely NOT be doing business with these people again on the strength (or severe lack thereof) of their customer service, which is quite possibly the absolute worse I have ever had to endure, as their staff are very ill-informed regarding travel regulations and 4 or 5 conversations provided me with totally conflicting information, which in total cost me well over £300 I am never going to see again (which could have been prevented with timely communication on their part).

We were trying to understand why they would not have mentioned to us that this was a possibility. Paying for luggage was not a problem, we had paid for checked in luggage. The problem was that lastminute did not, at any point during the booking process, inform us that the airline would charge XYZ for hand luggage. The point in a booking agency is that it is all sorted. This agency told us that hand luggage was included. At the airport, the airline said it was not. So we had to pay £29 each to take on our hand luggage even though the agency said it was included. The refusal to accept responsibility for their failure is absolutely shocking. But when you learn about the awful experiences people have had it isn't so shocking.

Aaron Brunger,Everything I needed at a sensible price,"I live in France and this trip was especially important as I was seeing my grandchildren, one of which I'd never seen.  I was originally staying at a hotel for 6 days at a cost of £945.  However, on reflection, I decided that the overall cost for what was being offered was too high.  Having less than a week before the departure of Le Shuttle, I decided that I would search on Last Minute dot Com.  Being disabled, I specifically needed a twin bedded room for myself and my carer.  Not only was I offered the room I needed but was offered it at a reduction if I selected it within 45 minutes.  It saved me over £400.  The Majestic Hotel in Eastbourne which like the other was on the seafront was in my opinion an excellent choice.  The staff were pleasant and friendly. They went beyond the norm to ensure my accomodation fully met my needs, even to the point of giving me an alternative room on the ground floor.  The breakfasts were excellent and my two dinners in the evening were the same.  Sadly, some of the in-house entertainment had to be cancelled due to lack of visitors attending but all visitors were offered the entertainment at their sister hotel, some 500 metres away - also on the seafront.

I then turned up at Radisson Blu at 9:50pm only to be told that the booking does not exist and that Last Minute have done this to several people. As I had already paid for my stay I had to ask my friend to pay for hotel as didn't have enough money left as they already took the money from my bank account but there was no hotel or booking. My trip (a graduation/birthday treat) is now ruined, have hardly any money left and cannot enjoy anything. I have spent whole evening stressed out, crying and panicking because the money has gone from bank account and they say my booking is confirmed but hotel say it is not. Now paid another £120 to hotel and nowhere to stay for tomorrow evening as no money left. I have letter from hotel manager and a new invoice that I am sending to bank in hope they will help as Lastminute don't reply, answer any query about this - tried everything but they just want to keep money and refuse to answer to any of it. I am contacting my bank and a solicitor first thing in morning and I will 100% take them to court if needs be, they can't be allowed to steal from customers like that as a legitimate company. Be warned. This company are  scammers through and through, they don't care about us as customers and will scam you if they can. Stick with booking.com or air bnb. Never ever had this trouble and it is so distressing, I just want to go home but have no flight for another day and sad thing is that we probably will have to stay on street tomorrow night.Update: Finally got a refund after threatening them with court and contacting ABTA. I think the letter from the hotel manager helped which basically said that they are a scam and have done this to several people at the same hotel and should refund me without delay. However, had to go through hoops because they just won’t help and will constantly blame everybody else, the hotel, the customer, etc. Will never in a million years book with them again regardless of price. Just is not worth it. They are dishonest, thieves and will simply abandon you once you pay them. Please stay away from this company, there are so many other decent ones out there to choose from. I’m just surprised why they haven’t been closed down. What they are doing is fraud and that is a criminal offence.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,07 June 2022

We only realised this late the night before because we needed a fit to fly certificate and had to wait for the results to come back before we could check in.  So there was no support available. When we arrived at the airport Ryanair charged us £110 to check in because we hadn’t done it online - even though they recognised it was impossible because of the fake email address.  Now Lastminute.com say they will take 28 days to look into this but their email is already blaming the airport when it was clearly their mistake.

james bradley,Being held to ransom,Two weeks ago I requested a date change to flights to Italy. I was quoted 160 euros and accepted on the basis it would take a maximum of four days to change. A week later I received another email from lastminute stating the price has increased to 300 euros I was advised to accept this swiftly to avoid further increases. I did this and was advised this would be changed within 4 days. Four days has passed and I haven’t received any updates and my booking has not changed: this is clearly a racquet to get the customer to pay higher and higher fares. I’ve contacted last minute and was advised that as soon as I accepted the change (within minutes of both emails) it is then forwarded to the airlines. What processes are in place to protect the consumer from this illegal activity as anybody with half a brain understands that the closer to the flight date it gets the more and more expensive the flight becomes!!!!!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,07 June 2022

This because of the flight we had to change.... To our surprise there was a problem with the booking. The rate applied to our booking only applies to UK citizens and not to Dutch citizens. In order to check-in I had to leave a large deposit to the check-in desk. According to the employee of Cleopatra Resort, the problem would have been solved in the morning. Unbelievable, what a nice way to start our holidays!To keep a long story short: I have been in touch each day of my staying with the local customer care by persons and of lastminute.com. I have been able to find out that the booking at the hotel had been made by the local office of Sun International on request of Jumbo Travel in Spain based on the booking I had made on Lastminute.com using the link on booking.com........ That sounds quite complex to me but why am I confronted with all of this.I have spent a lot of money calling the customer center of lastminute.com from Egypt. It costs you about 10 dollars only to go through the choices on the phone (they do not offer support via e-mail of chat). Unbelievable!

As we paid in full using a single voucher we thought that we would be refunded as a full single voucher. Noooooo LM decided to refund as 2 sweperate vouchers. Thus meaning our next trip would have had to be paid in part with one of the vouchers and cash as their website does not accept multiple vouchers.

Gary Smith,Lastminute.com :-(((,"A couple of positives here before I give the negatives:1. You can speak to someone on the phone and I usually got through straight away. Besides one guy all very friendly.2. Website seems fine to use. Now the problems:1. I could communicate with the customer service team but they seem to have zero ability to influence anything. Considering I had had my flight cancelled and needed answers they were fine with me waiting 9 days for an airline to get back to them to rearrange my flight. This is despite saying the airline had 7 days to respond (2weeks away from flying). When the airline again cancelled a flight it took the airline 10 days to respond. Again 7 days was quoted. Would be great to imagine that as they are working for me they actually follow up with the airline and chased up a response. But no. I will now miss earlier flights despite my situation apparently being a high priority. 2. They consistently tell me thanks for my patience and understanding. Essentially fobbing me off with usually no empathy. Unfortunately I do not understand why it takes an airline days on end to switch a flight they cancelled and I do not understand, considering the airline will only deal with lastminute.com why there is no interest in pushing for a resolution. No communication either unless I call or email. Lastly patience is not something you can expect when your customer is in limbo wondering whether they will fly or not and have to see plans and money evaporate. If possible avoid these as they cannot influence anything on your behalf and you then have to wait days and days for them and airlines to consider whether they can help you. Go direct if you can.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,02 June 2022
Andy Derwent,Complete lack of customer service,"I booked a holiday to Belfast with Lastminute.com in November 2021. I realised that I had made a mistake with the hotel that I had booked. I contacted Lastminute and asked if I could change my hotel. They indicated that it would be no problem and I agreed this with them.Over the weeks in the run up to my holiday I heard nothing and began to get a bit concerned. Every time I called the company I was reassured that it would be sorted soon. On the day of my flight I had still not heard anything. In desperation I called them from the airport and was reassured that everything would be sorted by the time I got to my new hotel. On arriving at the new hotel, I tried to check in but they had no record of my booking. I called Lastminute who assured me that they would contact the hotel. They did not. So I was forced to pay again for it. On returning, I emailed the company multiple times, including the chairman, and was repeatedly told it would be sorted. Finally, some two months later, coincidently just as I had approached the Association of British Travel Agencies, I received a refund of my money. All in all, I feel I only got my money back because of repeatedly spending my time chasing them. My advice would be to use somebody else to book your holiday!",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,02 June 2022

Brenda Naomi,Cancelled Flight- Overcharging,"Hi, So I don't know how to approach this situation anymore, I am so frustrated, annoyed, tired and stressed. Excited to have booked my flights to see my family aboard, who I haven't seen in 16years and also given I was unable to fly during Covid as I worked throughout the whole lockdown. Nonetheless very excited to have booked, all was ok all holidays for the adults booked off from work everything in place to be able to fly out without having left worries behind. But to find that it take Lastminute.com to let us know that they have cancelled my 1 of our group tickets because the flight price have increased?!?!?!?! Excuse me! my argument with them is, Why send out a booking confirmation, wait 5 days and then cancel saying that the price has changed? how does that make sense? Now, after receiving this disappointing news,  spoke to a few people, family members advised, luckily for us we have friends in the Travel industry, all advised to keep investigating because the agency can not cancel your flights once confirmed. I called lastminute.com customer service asking for assistance in the matter and there were a number of reasons as to why the booking was cancelled: - the cost of the flight increased-the airline cancelled the booking - the booking was done manually All of these reason for me is not good enough and it's very unprofessional. I called the airline myself, and they confirmed that as the booking was made through an agency only they can cancel the flight, and if the customer wants to cancel they can do so but the airline themselves unless booked directly with them can not be cancelled. I spoke to Samuel in customer service on Friday 27th May, I explained the situation and after going circles about them same thing I asked to speak to the manager or supervisor, he said it will take up to 48hrs for a call back but requested for immediate call back, it's now 30th May and no call back has been made. I spoke to Costa who was not very sympathetic nor understanding to say the least, on 29th May who said I would get a phone call that evening before 8pm. The response time is ridiculous. I called again today and spoke to Arlinda, and again she refused to listen to my situation and I asked for the supervisor or manager to call me and she said that they will not call even though I have already had 2 people say to me that it has already been organized for a call back. she then repeated that my booking had not been confirmed with the airline but I repeated to her that it had been but was cancelled by Lastminute.com as advised by the airline, she said that the ticket number was issued with the booking confirmation to which she replied saying that I was wrong and no ticket number had been sent with confirmation to which I was offended and was made out to seem as though I was lying but that was not the case I said to her that as soon as I get my ticket number I will call back and I hope that this situation can be sorted as I am not willing to pay out more money because they decided to charge more money than what was advertised. I called back and spoke to Malerdi who said he can put a form through for me to speak to management and have this situation rectified. I just think this is unfair, unprofessional, irresponsible and disgusting behavior from a company. The whole treatment I have received as a paying customer no-one should have to go through. I am now looking into making a claim towards them for wrongful doing. PLEASE CAN SOMEONE GET BACK TO ME ASAP.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,30 May 2022

Then spoke to customer care for them to tell me my booking got deleted that’s all they could tell me. I then Asked to speak to a manager but was told there is no customer care manager. Then ask to speak to a sales team but no success as apparently can’t transfer a call. I Can’t even book again until it’s refunded what a shambles. Asked for a email address I can contact someone else but completely wrong spelling of the email address. Due to fly in a couple of days and I’m still left with no response/refund utterly useless,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,29 May 2022

Caroline Storey,Appalling Service,"I booked a holiday in November with Last Minute. The booking experience was easy but I needed to make a room change almost immediately after completing the booking. I spent five months trying to contact Last Minute, they didn't reply to phone calls, emails or any other form of communication. Carrier pigeon might have worked better than anything else. In the end I went directly to the hotel to make the changes Completely ripped us off on the transfer booking and grossly understated how long the transfer would take. A journey of an hour was actually 2 and a half hours. I  used Last Minute so I could book everything in one go. Never again.Also worth noting is that they sell ryanair flights which Ryanair themselves have banned so the check in is a difficult process and because you can't check in until 24 hours before we had to pay additional fees to buy a seat as all the free seating was gone.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,28 May 2022

Garbage, I looked on the morning and flights WERE availableI went on to their chat facility and got no satisfactionI phoned 12 times in a 4 hour period and they often disconnected me.They didnt listen to my questions and they mostly didnt even understand EnglishI complained to the CEO of lastminute.com and heard nothing. Not even an ""autoresponse"".I have many more details to post here but space wont allow me to unfortunately.Which magazine has also reviewed them and warned people not to go near them. Enough said""For the second year running, Lastminute.com has the dubious distinction of being the worst booking site for flights and accommodation.  Not only is its website clunky and frustrating to use, but it’s poor at its main job of finding competitive prices.

We are almost here one week and lastminute has still not transferred the money to the hotel. This has caused very unpleasant interactions with the hotel staff saying we can’t stay any longer and that this is our fault. At the point where we don’t feel comfortable staying here right now, but unfortunately we don’t have much of a choice.

Scoopy,Fraudulant practices by lastminute,"This website/organisation is akin to a fraudulent organisation. I am shocked that the regulator has not shut them down. My experience is not unique to any circumstances, but it exposes fraudulent business practices. For air ticketing, the website charges the payment card immediately but doesn't issue the tickets immediately. This practice is not disclosed until you make the payment. On realising this is the case after making the payment I tried to contact their CS but neither my mobile number given during the booking process nor the booking reference sent to my email was recognised by the automated system and therefore I had no means to contact them. This is a fraud as the money is taken, but no contact is possible. None of the details are recognised and there is no other way to contact them. After failing to contact them I tried to call my card provider to flag the fraudulent transaction but in the meantime, I got another email stating that my air ticket can't be issued (no reason given) and that the amount will be refunded which can take > 2 days. So effectively the company charged my card for no service provided and left me out of pocket for many days which meant I wasn't able to book until I got my money back. During this time the ticket price increased significantly and I lost money.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,26 May 2022
Danny Bastidas,Where can I start?,"Where can I start?If you use their service and everything goes according to the plan, I guess that most likely you won't have any problem, unfortunately no my case (twice)My 1st mistake was around October 2021, I bought a flight ticket to December. Wizzair cancelled the flight and returned the money in full to LastMinute and here is where everything started. Lastminute offered me 3 different ways to have the refund of my money. Cash, credit with them and another one that I don't remember. I chose the cash and Lastminute informed me that I would only receive 30£ of 142£ that I spent. According to LastMinute it was because of administration fees, but they told me that if I want, and can keep the 142£ in credit with them. I chose take the credit (2nd mistake)Now in May I planned a family (my wife and kid) holiday to Rome, and I used the credit to book a hotel through LastMinute. The hotel cost me around 300 eur for 3 nights so I used the credit and paid the rest with my card.A week before my trip, the ""hotel"" (it wasn't a hotel, was a flat in an underground building -- absolutely awful) called me to cancel, but my booking was still confirmed on the LastMinute website. I thought for a moment to cancel the booking, but I was not sure that the money would be returned to me this time, It was odd for me that ""hotel"" cancelled and on the LastMinute website the booking was still as confirmed, so if I cancel the booking they might say that it was me and no the hotel and the money wouldn't be returned. I spent days talking to LastMinute, and they never cancel the booking on their website and they always tell me the same answer ""we are working on it"" On the day of my flight I finally received a call from LastMinute and they offered me another hotel which was based 18 miles away from the city center, the ""hotel"" that I booked was only 4 miles away. I refused to take that option. On the same last day I also contacted the ""hotel"" and finally they could accommodate me.On the LastMInute website,  hotel's pictures looks decent (only pictures of the flat were showing)  in fact the flat was tidy and clean when we arrived, but it was not a hotel, it was a flat (like Airbnb) in a building, the flat was under the ground and the outside street was a the same level as the flat window, you could see in the walls that the flat has suffered of leaking and the smell of the building was a mix of humidity and dirt -- AWFUUUL!!! Same night we walked through the street until we found another Hotel, which I had to pay another 300eur for the 3 nights.At the end I lost more money than my inicial 142£ and now I regret that I did not take my 30£ in cash.If you love yourself and your family, don't ever use this agency!!!Booking ID: 1844465692 (flight on december)Booking ID: 2002787898 (""Hotel"" in rome)",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,26 May 2022

Dani,Never again!,"I booked a weekend get away to rome for my fiancées birthday from 13/05-16/05. I am incredibly disappointed by the service I received at the hotel but also my the lack of being able to get hold of last minuite.com.Firstly the hotel room is not what I paid for. They put us in a standard double, and on your website the deluxe double looked to be advertised as a suite on their website.  (They do not advertise a deluxe double, nor do you advertise the suite). They basically were not very helpful and were condescending to myself and my fiancée. They were talking about us in Italian and it felt like they were mocking us. After speaking to a manager he said all he could do was to move us to another double room which was exactly the same as the one they previously gave us. The way that they were with me made me very uncomfortable and I felt anxious the whole time on the hotel because of this. I would not have booked this hotel if we were provided the correct information as it was significantly out the way but it seemed to have the best suite available. Secondly, we paid for transfers to and from the airport and we were not picked up from the hotel to get back to the airport. We had to pay for our own transport. We contacted the number on the documents provided and it stated the number was not available. Therefore please can I speak to someone to discuss these concerns or receive some form of compensation. I feel like this holiday has been ruined by all this.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,23 May 2022

I intuitively selected the default option which wasn't a good fit for me. I contacted their support the very next minutes and explained that I clicked the wrong button, I don't want the vouchers but the bank transfer in my account.

Tunii,Kept £200 and we got nothing!,"We booked a package deal for flights and hotel in Ibiza. We had to cancel a week ahead of the departure due to a thunderstorm around the time we were going. We called CS to ask to change flights to another country - Cyprus. They said ""sure""! We waited one day, then the next, then the next... heard nothing. We got an email saying the money for the hotel was being returned but they would be taking a massive chunk of it for cancellation and admin fees. What? We paid over £800 for hotel and got back £650. Okay... so what about my flight? We tried calling customer service and no one picks up. Just an automated voice and then it hangs up. We tried online chat and all we got were scripted messages from CS in Asia. They were very rude too and not helpful in the slightest. I asked about my flights and whether we'd be getting a flight to Cyprus as requested? We were meant to be leaving on Monday and the Ibiza flight tickets were still live on the airline site. CS said, ""we're working on it"". Okay...48 hours left until departure day and still no update. We went ahead and booked a hotel in Cyprus but didn't book flights as we were still hopeful that LastMinute.com would do something. 24 hours left until departure day. We call up, again, no answer. We try the chat and CS says, ""We're unable to get you another flight as your flights are non-refundable"". What? Why didn't you mention that initially when I requested a flight change? How are flight tickets non-refundable? They said, ""Because of the low price, we can't refund it"". So because it's chicken change to you, I can't have my money back? Overall, we got no flights, no hotel and lost well over £200 to them for nothing. We literally got nothing. They kept over £200 of my money for nothing.

Their customer care line told me I had received an email about this the day before but I categorically didn't receive any email (and still haven't despite me asking several times for them to resend it) and had I not checked the website I would have turned up in Paris with 2 kids and had nowhere to stay.I then spent the entirety of the next 2 days on the phone to lastminute.com trying to find out what they were going to do to arrange alternative accomodation for us as I was told that I would still have to pay for the flights even if we now had nowhere to stay. I must have made at least 15 phone calls and used their chat facility several times as well only to be told every single time that someone in another team would contact me about the issue. They were still telling me this at 8pm on the night before we were due to fly out and told me to get off the phone in case someone rang! No one whatsoever contacted me and I was forced to book and pay for the only other accomodation I could find still available in a similar area which was smaller, more expensive and a lower rating than what we had booked originally. The stress and frustration of spending 2 whole days arguing with their 'customer care' line that we were about to leave on our break and they needed to sort out our accomodation when we should have been preparing and getting excited ruined the whole holiday. We didn't even know if we were going to be able to go and I walked round with my phone permanently with me waiting for an email or phone call to say it had been sorted but it never came and they left us completely on our own with it.Since we returned I have been back on the phone and emails to them trying to sort out a refund for the accommodation that they cancelled. This eventually came but I am still fighting against their claim that I have to pay a cancellation fee despite the fact that it was lastminute.com that cancelled the accommodation and not us. I also want to be reimbursed for the extra money I had to pay for the new accomodation which was more expensive and have sent lastminute the invoice for this but here we are again with every email and phone call ending up with them saying someone is looking into it and they will get back to me. It is now almost a month since we returned and I am still waiting.I haven't written a negative review of a company before but I would NEVER book with this company again. I have been absolutely staggered at the treatment we received and wouldn't trust them with my money ever again.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,18 May 2022

I saw it immediately on receipt of conformation and phoned to explain. Was told bluntly there was nothing they could do. I then phoned the hotel who were more helpful. They said they had tried to contact lastminute for me but there was no reply. The hotel also said to inform lastminute that they were happy NOT to charge me for the mistake as the no refund policy was the hotel's, not lastminute's. I rang lastminute to tell them this and the man on the phone said yes if you can send proof of the email from the hotel it will be refunded.

Nathan,Great until something goes wrong. Avoid.,"I have had two experiences with LastMinute.com over the past month or so. The first was one of the simplest and successful booking experiences I have ever had. So it is unfortunate that the second experience has led me to writing this review.I had a hotel booked in London for some training at the end of the month. Unfortunately the training was cancelled due to low numbers, and rebooked later in the year. So obviously I went onto my booking to see if it could be amended - it was booked as a nonrefundable so I wasn't expecting to be able to. Upon clicking through to the booking it took me to a 'refund processing checklist'.Within 5 minutes I was through to someone on the phone who told me that it was an immediate process and nothing could be done, despite me not cancelling in the first place. I assumed it was the usual not being able to do anything because of system limitations, and that to speak to a manager I would need to wait 48 hours.Rang back to try a different operator, as although the operator was very friendly, it was clear he wasn't going to do anything about it. The second operator told me there would be an additional £120 cancellation fee...which was confusing. Paying to cancel and not get a refund? I asked a couple more times to confirm that was the case, and each time came to the same conclusion. As this was paid with a business card I asked what card it was going to be taken from (if it was personal I could deal with it, if business, it would be a problem). The second operator hung up on me as I asked this.Went on to online chat, verification again etc. Then eventually confirmed that the £120 was not an additional charge, but was to be taken off the refund. Which I guess they thought negated the cost, but originally as I had paid more, maybe there is a refund of like £15 coming through.The online chat person then told me that ""the hotel has not issued us with a refund, so we cannot refund it"". So I rung up the hotel. This was a fairly small single site hotel, very friendly on the phone. They found the booking for me but couldn't do anything, because they aren't given any money by LastMinute.com until the booking date.So now I am waiting on a callback from someone there. But currently not happy at all. It's been a confusing process with seeming ICT/customer journey issues, being hubng up on and then also lied to about why a refund can't happen (I don't need one, because didn't cancel).So from the first experience and second experience combined...great....until something goes even slightly wrong. Then expect to get incredibly poor customer service, a long confusing time and outrageously long waiting times to complain or speak to someone more senior. I can't even imagine if there was a flight involved in this.Avoid at all costs. Book direct with hotels/airlines.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,17 May 2022

Then emailing amd calling backwards and forwards from last minute as to whether I was getting a refund or another holiday. This went on for months causing me undue stress whilst working in the nhs. They don't care about the  money that they took from people. Finally I was offered a refund they sent an email link. Lo and behold the link didn't work. I have tried multiple times I still get the automated email to a link that went through to blank screen. I called them multiple times and then talked me through how to get it to work clear your cache reset your account. Angrily I did everything they asked sent multiple screenshot to their email address. Finally i got through to the 'refund page' to enter my iban. Lo and behold it dosent work. I've called to find an alternative method. None has been given. Attemped to call my bank and get a refund they even refused cause it had been to long. This has gone on for two years now. I still get the automated message. Nope I'm 2000 out of pocket for a holiday I never went on. Then I look on Wikipedia this morning and they are voted the worst holiday provider to refund people's money during the pandemic. They are probably broke. And don't care about the fact they kept the company running with holidays that consumers didn't go on. You should be ashamed of your selves. Sitting in your white castles.

Client 1,Poor service - Don't Use,6/5/2022 and my return flight has been cancelled by the airline via a text message. No action by lasminute.com to find me another return flight or communicate re this cancellation since then. I contacted Corendon Airlines to get them to cancel from their side as no alternative flight on that day.I have checked and the only direct flight to Manchester on that day is £200 more expensive. I  have contacted LastMinute.comc daily and I am read the same script that I will be contacted within 7 to 14 days and an agent is looking into the matter. I have booked my train tickets already so they will also need to be changed. I will never ever book with them again. I don't trust them to help me or pay the difference. I booked this Holiday Package 20th March. No amended invoice excluding the return flight. Frustrating to say the least.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,12 May 2022

James Ollig,DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY,"Let me start off this complaint/review by saying, if you’re considering using any other booking website I would strongly advise you use them. I’m both disgusted and disappointed with the treatment of lastminute.com staff. We booked a long weekend (4 days) to Rome back in April for a may departure. We paid extra to have the early flight out 6:25am and the late inbound flight 5.30pm. On the 11th of May I was double checking the flights and check in information, slights we’re still the same as the ones above on the app, until about 3:30pm. Without our knowledge, LM changed our flights to an evening outbound and a morning inbound flight resulting in us losing 2 whole days. When I questioned this I was met with aggression, a completely lack of professionalism and a generally rude staff member who refused to put me through to a senior member of staff. The LM customer service informed me that I received an email in April to warn me of these changes (I did NOT). They also informed me that it’s not sent from a “last minute” email account and is likely in spam, again, I checked, it isn’t. You would assume that they would notify you on the app of any changes, but no. The reason our original flights were changed was because the 4 flights that day all got changed to around an hour later, so instead of moving us from the first flight of the day to the first flight of the day after changes, LM moved us to the last fight of the day. We had activities booked for the afternoon that were pre-paid for which we will not not receive a refund for. I actually had some very big plans for the Saturday with my POTENTIAL fiancé which were completely ruined and spoiled the whole trip. We are currently waiting to hear back from a flight time change request, I have been on the Ryan air site and checked the flight availability and both our original flights still have seats. I do not expect LM to change our flights back though as it isn’t in their best interest. I will be seeking some sort of refund considering we paid for the most expensive flight and got moved conveniently to the cheapest. I hope that a Last Minute staff member who actually cares about customers gets in touch with me, as the couple that I’ve spoken to so far we’re vile.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,12 May 2022

I explained I was told I would receive an email with a quote so I could pay for it…the person just snapped back at me and again said they tried calling me. So I asked for a quote for a new flight home….regardless of the original … I just wanted a flight home…and I’m not sure if this person had any clue what they were doing but she said she couldn’t help me….so in reality …last minute just left me stranded in Turkey.

Many months / a year went by, where they claimed to be still waiting on a refund from the airline in order to refund me. I contacted the airline directly, who said they had refunded Lastminute.com and that I needed to speak to them about it, but LM still claimed the opposite. Just last week (over 2 years since my cancelled flight) they emailed me to say, actually, they won't be refunding me after all.

Rosie,This company is beyond awful,"This company is beyond awful. You can never speak to someone - the phone lines are an endless circle of menus which more often than not lead nowhere except to the automated system hanging up on you. My flight was cancelled by the airline, it took lastminute.com 3 weeks to inform me of that which meant I had to wait all that time to start the refund process. My friend booked directly with the airline and this is how I found out the flight was cancelled before lastminute.com told me. Once lastminute.com emailed me to inform me my flight had been cancelled, they told me I had to contact the airline for the next steps and that I couldn't do anything via the lastminute.com account. I spent 2 hours on hold with the airline for the airline to tell me that lastminute.com had to put in the refund request for me. I then spent hours on hold with lastminute.com to ask them to put in the refund request. At this point I told the operator it was awful that I couldn't simply do this online as they clearly don't want people calling their phone lines. The operator told me that I could but this was just not true. I received the confirmation of the refund today and it turns out they have charged me £50.00 to process the refund, which is an obscene amount of money to charge for such a service. I did not cancel the flight, the airline did. I had no option but to request the refund via lastminute.com as the airline wouldn't accept my request to do so. This feels like extortion; as a customer I had no options here and lastminute.com are taking advantage of that. Just awful, I only booked through this terrible company as I had won a voucher at work. I'll NEVER use this company again and I advise everyone to avoid them, even if you find a cheap deal as they will take any money they can from you.

How is that even legal?? We did not cancel anything, the terms and conditions state customers are entitled to a full refund if cancelled by lastminute/the provider  These are copied from their own terms and conditions - **In the unlikely event that the airline cancels or amends your booking (for example due to scheduling changes), or is otherwise unable to fulfil your booking, we will use reasonable efforts to contact you as soon as reasonably possible using the contact details you provided at the time of booking. If the airline is unable to fulfill your booking and is unable to provide an alternative, your booking will be cancelled with a full refund.** - however now they are doing everything they can to not give us our money back and even said we are not entitled to a refund (and it was not a small amount we spent).  There was no alternative offered, and we had to spend more money re-booking our own flights with another provider.It is absolutely sickening that this is allowed to go on - I will NEVER use lastminute.com ever again - and I strongly urge others to avoid at all costs.

Holly C,Worst company ever,"Well, where do I start. Friday 6th May I was looking at flights on lastminute.com via my phone, I had a discount voucher that I wanted to see if it would give be a discount on flights with lastminute which would make them cheaper than elsewhere.I could see nowhere to put the voucher code after going through the main options, and was at the stage where I could add in my payment details but below this was a button that said ""review"". I thought if I reviewed the payment/flights I would have the option to add in the discount code before confirming payment. I clicked this button and it immediately took payment without warning, no discount applied and I had not meant to book flights. I immediately tried to contact you. Your phone lines just give automated responses, the agents on the online chat said they couldn't do anything. Finally got to speak to someone by going through option about adding things to your trip. The man I spoke to said he could out my payment through as a ""void"" transaction (not sure what this means but he seemed to know what he was talking about) and I would get a full refund within around 4 days. I said ok and we proceeded, but that I only wanted to proceed if I would get a full refund as I would have to repurchase flights and it would end up costing me more than this booking. I also requested I speak to a manager to make a complaint, he said the only way I could do this was to request a callback within 24 hours so I said ok to this.Saturday 7th May I received an email saying my flights had been cancelled and my refund processed. However then Sunday 8th May I received another email saying my flights were confirmed. Rang up again, now they are saying I can't have a refund because my flights had been cancelled - but I was told Friday I would, and I only wanted to proceed if I was to get a refund, as I will have to buy more flights anywhere (and now be more out of pocket overall). I also hadn't had the manager callback, the agent said they couldn't see the callback request (annoyingly) and said they would put in another request. Monday 9th May, still have had no callback, said I would be called back during the day. Now tells me previous agent has sent my case for review and will take up to 28 days. Incredibly annoying - I need the money to book more flights for my already booked holiday end of June. Still awaiting call during the day. Tuesday 10th May, notification I am being offered a £54 refund (for an almost £300 booking). Ridiculous. Call again, this time they say they can't see the manager callback request from Sunday - losing it a bit at this point. Says I need to wait another 24 hours until now she says 48 hours. Says they have no power to do anything such as transfer me to a manager. I get very upset but still not resolution. I do not trust what I am being told. Everytime I call up the call to the manager seems to get pushed onto a later date with no record of it being made at a previous date. I want my money back - I have been forced into buying something in error due to your website, given advice by one of your customer service agents that has left me almost £300 out of pocket and I am not even managing to speak to anyone who knows what they are doing!!",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,10 May 2022

Couple of days prior to the holiday I came down with Covid and had to cancel my part in the holiday.   On notifying Lastminute was informed that had to provide PCR result this I did (at extra expense to myself). 3 weeks after placing my claim and after numerous chaser messages I received text from lastminute customer care team that I was not entitled to a refund, one of the reasons given being that the holiday included flight with low cost airline (Ryanair) .    This I disputed and asked why a condition of such importance was not highlighted at time of booking? I was referred to the small print terms and conditions.At this time feeling unsatisfied at the deception  I felt it best to put matter into the hands of my 3rd party insurance. In order to pursue claim and required by my insurance party  I asked lastminute for breakdown in the cost,  this since the original booking invoice included all in price (family 3 adults + 2 children age 5 & 2) . to my alarm, lastminute refused to give this information stating that the booking system was not set up to provide me with breakdown of cost.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,10 May 2022

Timothy,Good time at Decameron Agadir,"The hotel and flight was a bargain for 8 nights. I booked promo-room and had a first floor balcony overlooking the pool area. The hotel restaurant has panoramic views looking over the promenade and beach so great views at every meal. The pool is a nice size and not too busy. The lobby is really impressive and the staff were uniformly helpful and friendly. I went the last week of April and it was hot and sunny nearly every day except for one which was a bit overcast. I didn’t see a single mosquito while I was in Morocco. The Moroccan people are really friendly and the shopkeepers will leave you alone if you say no politely. The food was good and varied. The best dishes are the local stuff such as tagline and aubergine, understandably. The beach in Agadir is really nice, the sea is shallow, clear and surprisingly warm. The whole area felt safe and police patrol regularly- good for jogging on the promenade for men or women. The hotel gym is also pretty good with views over the pool area. I did day trips to Marrakech and Paradise Valley- both alright but not necessary to leave Agadir if you just want beach and pool holiday. I would love to visit again and possibly try a bit of surfing round the coast or do one or two of the desert activities. Most of the tourists are French but are well behaved and friendly so good if you want to avoid the rowdier elements. The only drawback is that the pavements on the road have been ripped up and are being replaced so would have to get transport into the town if you have any mobility issues. I flew with Ryanair to and from Stansted (have had a bad experience before) but all went smoothly. Just note that my PCR test was only looked at once briefly on initial check in and the Health form for Morocco was just picked up on landing and not looked at.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,08 May 2022
Amy McCulloch,No stars would be a more accurate.,"No stars would be a more accurate description of my experience. I booked a trip to Barcelona LAST summer, paid everything off by August. As soon as I paid everything my flights were changed cutting my trip short and no alterations were made to my hotel stay - so I was paying for a night I was no longer in the country let alone the hotel. Tried to get this fixed and was given no solution every time I rang. Rude customer service advisors that don't listen to your problem and want to chase you off the phone. Finally got back to me  a month and a half before the trip telling me it would cost me roughly an extra £500 pounds for a flight the following day and had the audacity to include a £70 service charge in this? Asked to speak to management and was blatantly ignored so I had no choice but to cancel my trip. It's been almost 2 weeks now and been sent none of my refund options which the company has apparently pledged to solve within 2 weeks. This company is an absolute disgrace. Don't book with them",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,08 May 2022

No contact was made by email and no SMS link provided. Ever.On arrival at the hotel it was obviously closed for the season. On ringing we were taken to another hotel.  They were clearly expecting us...yet Lastminute had not informed us of any alteration to our booking.

Poppy Owen,USELESS SCAMMERS,"I booked a package holiday through lastminute.com to Amsterdam, Netherlands. Due to the COVID restrictions in place at the time for entering the Netherlands, myself & my partner could no longer go ahead with the holiday as we would not be fully-vaccinated in time and therefore would not be allowed to enter the country. A few months ahead of the booking, I called lastminute.com to query if I able to sell the holiday to a friend and if it would be possible to change the details over to a her details, as her and her partner were fully-vaccinated and could able to attend the trip. On a recorded phone call I was assured that the changes could be made, the lady on the phone took all details such as both passenger’s names, DOB and email address'. She stated that a new invoice with the updated details would be emailed to me with the changes that I had made. I also queried whether there would be a cost to change the details over and was told that because I was altering the details in advance that I would not incur a fee. After a few days I had still not received the new invoice, therefore I rang up again to query the invoice and was told it could take a few more days and that I should receive it soon. After numerous phone calls to the company I had still not received a new invoice but had been reassured over the phone multiple times that the changes had been made. I the received an email from the company stating that any emails would now be going to my friend as they had swapped the email address’ over, therefore realised that the changes had been made. After calling lastminute.com yesterday to query something else, with now four weeks until the holiday we were told that in fact none of the changes had been made and that we would have to contact the flight company and the hotel ourselves to query any changes to the either and this was not something that they could do. After calling Essyjet I have been quoted £220 to change the passenger details. Lastminute.com is there to provide a service, for people to book package holidays where they do not need to contact the flight company or the hotel as it is all dealt with internally through the service that we are paying for. We are now getting extremely close to the date of the booking and neither me or my friend can now go as the changes cannot be made and the COVID restrictions still stand that you cannot enter the Netherlands without being fully-vaccinated. During another phone call with an employee at lastminute.com I requested that either the changes are made or I would cancel the whole booking, to which I was told I was not eligible for a refund and that they were not able to change the details on the flight. I was denied any access to speak to a manager or someone other than a contact centre assistant and told that there is nothing else that they can do.  This meant that now with four weeks until the holiday booking me and my friend are now left extremely stressed and angry towards the company and also out of pocket. After being told that I am not eligible for a refund and cannot attend the holiday I do not wish to have anything to do with the company again. I have experienced a huge lack of reassurance from the company and am worried that I have spent close to £500 that I will never see again. I want to cancel the holiday, I believe I should be eligible for a full refund as this situation has only occurred due to the company giving me false hope and false information and false promises. If I had of been told that the changes couldn't have been made when I first called to query I would have had to cancel the trip months ago but instead I have been lead on until now with false information. I no longer want to make the changes to the booking as I do not want anything to do with this awful company.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,05 May 2022

Mile,Flight disruption,"Hello lastminute,9€ refund is kind gesture from you, but you caused me and my travel commpanion much more costs and dificulties during this booking.First, information about duration of outbound flight from Zagreb to Basel you provided on your site was wast incorrect. On your site wrote that flight lasts 30 minutes and it lasted about 90 minutes. Taking your information about flight duration for granted I booked and buyed online a return non-refundable and non-changeble train tickets from Basel to Bern in advance that costed me a 100 euros ( too return tickets for me and my companion). Because flight lasted an hour longer we missed the booked trained and we had to by another too tickets on Basel train station SBB that costed 95€ in one directions.Second inconvience that caused additional cost an long waiting time at airport was return flight disruption. We should originaly travel from Basel to Amsterdam at 18.25 h on april 23rd with KLM, but that morning we recieved a message from lastminute that our flight was disrupted et rebooked for 14.10 same day ( 4h 15 min in advance) to Frankfurt with Lufthansa. That not only corrupted our originaly plans but also we couldn't use the return train tickets from Basel to Bern we already buyed , and had to by another ones for 94€. So only train tickets caused us additional costs of 189€ , which together with previously payed but unused tickets ( 100€ )makes 289€.Third ,our reschedulled Lufthansa flight from Basel to Frankfurt was 30 minutes late so we missed connected flight with Croatia Airlines from Frankfurt to Zagreb which was scheduled for 15.45( boarding time 15.15) .Because of that we had to wait next Croatia Airlines flight for Zagreb which was scheduled for 20.45h. So that caused us 5h additional waiting time at Frankfurt airport.Beside discomfort,  5h of delay caused us additional cost of  100€. Also had to cancel previosly scheduled bisnis mitting in Zagreb, and we came home in Banja Luka Bosnia in Sundey morning which was orthodox Easter, greatest Hollidday in our country.For every afformentioned events caused by you, I think that we are in title for some kind of commpensations and refund.Beeing a  big online  travel agent , we hope that you care about your reputation and costumers satisfaction, and that you will figure out a way for appropriate commpensation for your costumers.Thanks in advance.Mile & Srdjan",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,04 May 2022

Consumer,ChangeyourbookingattheLastminute.com,"Best not to go with Lastminute.com, thought the holiday to Budapest would be what I had booked but everything changed as time went on, they even changed the hotel the night before we flew.  So stressful and I don’t get stressed.  The hotel boat I was looking forward to staying on went bust a week before going out, 4 further hotels were offered as each one changed its offers daily, the flight was brought forward a full day even though we had paid for 4 nights so we only got 3, losing a day’s holiday.  Booking in online to return was so difficult whilst out there that we missed the window, the airport wanted to charge us for checking in there until we kicked up a fuss.  You may say these were not Lastminutes’ fault but it all relates back to them as we had little or no control and they just left us stranded with a ‘get on with it yourself’ attitude.  Thankfully we made the most of our few days in Budapest as the people are lovely, the city is fascinating, excellent transport system and very clean all over.

They couldn’t cancel my original booking but I had to book a new one for the following day before they could cancel and refund me. All because the booking confirmation with a paragraph entitled ‘what you must bring to collect your hire car’ did not specify that I had to bring a DVLA code. I could only call DVLA the following day during opening hours. Suffice to say, I had a wasted day, spent extra money on hotel, food and taxis and in the end got a smaller car than originally ordered (seeing as the car I originally ordered was still booked out to me whilst booking the new order with them!) I eventually got a refund a week later but I had to pay £25.57 for the privilege.

To top it all off you can still book the same holiday with a difference of 10mins on the train time but at a cost of another £1000. Why has last minute not compensated us and moved us onto another train time?Currently looking for other companies with suitable options to get us away but looking at paying a lot more and as we don’t have the refund in bank looking like a waste of time.

Julie Clarke,Customer service is atrocious.,"I am very dissatisfied with the two agents I spoke with. I was required to take a PCR test no earlier than 1 day before my flight, and didn’t receive the results until 8pm (my flight was the next morning at 10am) my results were indeed positive and I began to panic as to what I needed to do next.  I immediately called the british airways and asked what I needed to do next. They canceled my outbound flight so I wouldn’t be marked as a no show, then suggested I call Last Minute to reschedule my new outbound flight. Each time I called the agents kept speaking over me saying there was nothing they could do as it was less than 24 hours before my flight. I explained over and over that British airways canceled my flight so I was NOT within 24 hours anymore. They didn’t listen and still wouldn’t help. I also paid extra for the premium coverage so that I could have flexibility with my flight last minute as we are still in the middle of a pandemic and my PCR test did still say positive even though it’s been almost 2 weeks since I first became ill. I expected for them to do SOMETHING to help as that is why I paid extra for flexibility. And also when I called British airways, the representative told me that they have a phone line specifically for booking agents to call in events like this and that they were not supposed to direct me to call the airline. Both agents were incredibly rude to me and offered absolutely no assistance with my issues. I will definitely not be using lastminute.com ever again and will be very vocal about my experience as this was unacceptable.

Once accepted, we hadnt had any confirmation or our booking updated online after 2 weeks.

We should have been told this 17 days ago when we first questioned it. Also the only other flights that are available to get us to our destination on the same day are with another airline.

Ms YuVain,lastminute.con,"Please beware of lastminute.com trap.We were planning to spend Easter holidays volunteering at the railway station in Berlin working with Ukrainian refugees. We booked BA flights London to Berlin  via lastminute.com and paid £1130. Then my husband tested positive for Covid a few days before the flight. We had to cancel the flights and sent lastminute.com’s customer service a copy of his flow test together with a request to issue a voucher. The helpline staff could not say if we were entitled to the voucher, and what our terms of carriage are. They kept sending us to BA. BA refused to discuss it altogether because we did not book with them directly. A million phone calls and emails later, and 2 weeks after I sent lastminute a copy of the Covid flow test, their Customer Service asked us to produce a copy of a PCR test - or else we will not get any compensation. No other tests are acceptable ‘due to airline policy’ we are told.However my husband has recovered by now and clearly it is too late to get tested.It seems that @lastminute did their best to ensure we never get any compensation and they get to keep the money we paid for the flights. I have a customer service email advising me that I am not entitled to receive evouchers without a PCR test. This had not been made clear to me in any of my numerous calls to their helpline.The strangest thing is that BA are now saying they have in fact issued vouchers in our names, and sent them to lastminute.com.Beware of lastminute.CON.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,27 April 2022

It's been 2 months and I still didn't get the refund. Recently I got an email saying the return journey was also changed and that I can get a refund for that one as well. The email contained a link that in theory should have let me ask for a refund. The link is broken, there's an error on the page when trying to tap on it.

They originally claimed that it was not possible to receive a refund for the whole trip due to only one flight change (understandable), so we just asked for a refund for the cancelled flight and nothing else. We have now rebooked another flight, and Last minute have gone and cancelled our whole trip including the hotel and other flight. Even after 4/5 emails of me saying please do not do that! So now just 2 weeks before the trip I am left with no hotel and flight and they are still not helping, just sending generic emails suggesting it was my fault to ask for the refund.

The Friday before that, an agent said they will change my flight to a month later and I have to wait for a confirmation. The next day I didn’t hear anything. So I contacted them and they said to just wait. Day after that they couldn’t find the request, but I took pictures of the conversations I had. Then they were able to find it, but said to wait again. Monday: day of the flight. No confirmation. No email. No phone call. Got in contact with many agents this day and all they offered were apologies and that they can’t take the request, because it’s now less than 24 hours.

When I did that, they informed me that according to their terms and conditions, it should be the agent making the change.

Andy Wright,Very poor booking experience,"We tried to book flights from London to Queenstown at the lastminute.com web site. There was a surcharge of over £60 for not using a Visa Electron. Technically it said that using Visa Electron gives a discount ... but it actually means that using anything else gives a surcharge. Maybe this avoids UK laws which prohibit charging more for credit card payments. Anyhow, the booking failed for no particular reason ... just an error message that said there was a problem with no explanation as to what the problem was. I tried using Amex and also PayPal. In the end I just booked directly with the airline. This cost a little bit more but the booking actually worked and the prices they quoted were the prices they charged. I also feel more confident about dealing directly with the airline than with lastminute.com, so in the end I think I'm glad that the booking process failed.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,20 April 2022

Miss Demi Courtney Boyce,DO NOT BOOK WITH LASTMINUTE!!!,Well. Where do I even begin. I wouldNot even give this company a one star. I booked a trip for me and my partner for his birthday and we weren’t even told that one of the flights were cancelled we only found this out by trying to add baggage to our flight and the flight didn’t exist last minute lied to us and told us that they hadn’t heard from the airline yet the airline had told them. We then had to chase up an alternative fly and it took them five days to even send us this one we could find loads of flights ourselves. Once we got the alternative flight we agreed on this and rang them and they said we have to wait for the airline to confirm that you can go on this flight and we had about 11 days until the trip. We rang every day up until the 11th day and the people on the phone were like robots and told us that we would hear by 8 pm before they close all by the morning every single day and by the last few days the operators told us that it was confirmed and that we were going on holiday that we just needed to wait for the confirmation email. Even when we looked up the alternative flight there were over 50 free seats. so we turned up to the airport and turns out we weren’t even booked onto the flight and easyJet had not even had any communication with last minute at all they hadn’t communicated and they had lied to us on the phone and we had missed out on our holiday. Now I’m trying to chase up a refund but getting through to them is so difficult and they are reading off the script and it sounds like I’m going to have to get legal advice and a lawyer involved. Don’t waste your money and do not book an overseas trip with this company they will just take your money and will not communicate with you at all about this and it will be really hard to get a refund.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,20 April 2022

The only issue that we had was at the RyanAir gate at Birmingham Airport where they did not recognise the LM electronic Boarding Pass and were not going to accept it at one stage and refuse us on to the plane! The other attendant worked with us and got us onboard but this was simply an issue with an individual from Ryan Air. Hotel in Benalmedena was fantastic, friendly staff, clean and modern hotel rooms, sky bar at roof level, breakfast was fabulous. Plenty of local restaurants to chose from for our evening meals as only opted for B&B. Only negative was the Ryan Air part of the trip at the beginning.

I checked the flight reservation number listed in the email and the carrier returned a no such reservation number.Even after Momondo contacted them, they never got back in touch. Part of the money has been refunded to my friends, but there is still $3000 out there they have not returned.I see someone on here was trying to say that to cancel last minute reservations you have to do it with the airline as per LM terms.

I simply wanted to contact them to ask why my 2nd payment hadn't been taken, but my account was stating I was up to date with payments - I chose their payment plan so I could budget so it worried me that the money hadn't left my bank account. I've called multiple times over the last few weeks(!) since booking, each time the line cut out after asking you for your booking details with no further information provided. These calls are charged. You cannot email, the only option was to call. They have finally made live chat available, and no one answered till I threatened to post a Trust Pilot review. There is clearly no customer service, organisation, admin/finance accuracy, no clear updates: This will be the first and last time I book with lastminute.com",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,09 April 2022

Tarek Metwally,An extremely bad experience and non…,An extremely bad experience and non caring customer service when I have booked a flight for my mother from Cairo to london on 3rd of April .I have received a booking confirmation without an E ticket till they 9th of April when the flight is due to be on the 10th April .I have spoken to the customer service on 8th April when they said they are going to send me a confirmation email but ofcourse nothing and then called them on the 9th of April just before the flight and the customer service told me that there is no way they can manage to get me the ticket before the flight date and they don’t know why I didn’t receive a ticket and asked me if I am happy to cancel which I did no to receive the money back in 14 long days for booking nothing.Horrible experience,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,09 April 2022
